from my observations  not guaranteed to be 100  accurate  most of the time it starts playing the video in auto  auto seems to select medium quality  480p   when you go full screen auto wants to pick high quality  720p   unfortunately  the way that youtube s technology is set up it seems to require you to reload the video  most websites will just stick with one quality  eg vimeo might just start you at 720p by default   that way when you swap to full screen it does nt need to reload anything  there is also some video technology  what netflix uses  that can upgrade quality without needing to reload  but youtube does nt use that  i would have to venture to say that most of the other players you ve been using have been providing you with low quality content  youtube  bt default now  i think  changes quality on fullscreen from whatever the default on your computer is  to the maximum allowed   you can change this preference though settings   when you fullscreen specifically  it has to immediately switch to a higher quality stream  and thus takes a second to buffer  youtube videos will start default at 480p  fullscreen will change it to highest available quality  in your settings you can change it so your default would always be hd  or 320p ,0
my biology teacher in college had a phrase that accounted for many of these types of dilemmas   evolution is sufficient  not efficient   did it manage to reproduce  were those reproductions good enough to survive and make more  that s it  that s why lots of our parts are crappy  our backs  knees  etc  these problems exist in all animals  but as long as it s  good enough   it ll keep getting passed down  actually  evolution is what gave humans the larger brains that make childbirth so painful  be glad it is nt worse than it is  if human babies popped out at the same equivalent of mental development as horses  humans could walk an hour after birth  human babies are born at low levels of  completeness  which is why it takes a human child so long to develop out of infancy  i really hope this makes some kind of sense  i m a lousy explainer  evolution can not account for random occurrences  for instance  a lot of the time when a cow or horse needs a lot of help during birth  it s because the baby has somehow managed to wrap itself up in the umbilical chord  or turn in such a way that is too large to fit through the birth canal ,0
tv shows that depict illegal activities like street racing or manufacturing illegal alcohol often work with law enforcement to ensure that the people involved in the show are not breaking any laws the show might film in a location where the activity is legal or the producers might obtain permission from the authorities to film certain activities additionally the people depicted in the show might be actors rather than real people engaging in illegal activities in this way the tv show can depict illegal activities without anyone getting arrested because they are not actually breaking any laws,1
the joker is crazy  but more than that  he is convinced that the rest of the world is crazy too and just does nt see it  his goal is to expose that everyone else is just deluded into thinking they are better than him  by bringing out the worst in people  basically he is the opposite of batman  while batman tries to inspire  the joker tries to break people down  well  as alfred puts it in the dark knight   some men just want to watch the world burn   the joker is simply insane and is nt really trying to achieve anything  basically the joker wants to batman to kill him  however batman will never kill the joker being that he believes in  represents justice  the joker will never kill batman because his goal is to prove that there is evil inside of everyone especially batman and until he brings that evil out he will never stop ,0
they will likely jump ship asap once something better comes along  training cost time and money  a person who is  overqualified  would be likely to pursue and find a more deserving wage at another job  that means that an employer has three options   offer the more experienced candidate the job at a higher wage than you want to pay   offer the more experienced candidate the job at the market wage rate at the risk of them finding a better job and having to spend more money making a second hire for the same position  or  offer the less  experienced candidate the job  since they re less likely to leave for another employer  because most people  are nt  willing to work for the pay and stay in the job  they re going to leave in a few months when they finally find a higher paying job that they re properly qualified for  hiring people is a pain in the ass  it takes a lot of time  takes business owners  managers away from doing productive work  training people costs money as well  nobody wants to put in the work to hire somebody  train them just to see them leave in 2  3 months ,0
wikipedia has a solid article on money market funds which includes a section on breaking the buck when the money market fund fails to return its full dollar  money market funds smoothing out the daily generally small fluctuations of investing in shortterm treasuries directly but have similar risk over longer periods  some funds can and have lost money in market crashes though even the worst performers still returned 95 cents on the dollar while few investments are guaranteed and likely none in your retirement account  moneymarket funds are likely the choice you have with the least fluctuation and similar minimal risk to short term treasuries however a second important risk to consider is inflation  money market funds generally have returns similar or less than the inflation rate  while money markets funds help you avoid the fluctuations of the stock market the value of your retirement account falls behind the cost of goods over time  unless the investor is fairly old most financial professionals would recommend only a small portion of a retirement account be in money market instruments  vanguard also has a set of target retirement investment funds that are close to what many professionals would recommend  consulting a financial professional to discuss your particular needs is a good option as well,0

it is generally considered safe to take soy isoflavones while taking metformin however it is important to consult with a healthcare provider before taking any new supplement especially if you are trying to conceive or are taking other medicationsnnsoy isoflavones are plantbased compounds that are similar to the hormone estrogen they are found in soybeans and other legumes and are sometimes taken in supplement form some studies have suggested that soy isoflavones may help regulate menstrual cycles and improve fertility in women with polycystic ovary syndrome pcos a common cause of fertility problems however the evidence is not strong and more research is needed to confirm these findingsnnmetformin is a medication commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes and pcos it works by decreasing the amount of sugar produced by the liver and increasing the sensitivity of muscle cells to insulin which helps lower blood sugar levels it is generally considered safe and effective for these purposes but it is important to follow the dosage and frequency recommendations of a healthcare providernnit is always a good idea to discuss any changes to your medication or supplement regimen with a healthcare provider before making them they can help you weigh the potential risks and benefits and determine the best course of action for your specific situation,1
a refrigerator is a machine that is used to keep things cool it does this by using a chemical called refrigerant which gets cold when it is turned into a gas and then hot when it is turned back into a liquid the refrigerant goes through a cycle of getting cold and hot over and over again to keep the inside of the refrigerator coldnnif a refrigerator is placed outside in subzero temperatures it will still try to keep the inside of the refrigerator cold however it will have to work harder to do this because the cold air outside is trying to get inside the refrigerator and make it cold too this means that the refrigerator will use more energy and may not be able to keep the inside as cold as it would be if it were inside a warm housennthere are special refrigerators that are designed to work in very cold places like antarctica these refrigerators use special refrigerants that can still work well even in very cold temperatures they also may have extra insulation to help keep the cold air inside and the hot air outside,1
most speech to text software works based on machine learning algorithms that use statistics  the gist of it is that you can  teach  computer software to become good at pattern matching  by analyzing the wave pattern of the sound you make when you say words  and by telling the computer what the word is for each pattern  you can train the computer software to match a sound pattern to a word  so if you have a large amount of voice clips  and someone has transcribed all those clips  you have created something called  training data   which you can feed into the software to teach it how to match those patterns  accents will effect the probability of matching if the software was nt trained with recordings of accents  but that s easily fixable by adding accented data to the training data  i ll try to do that really simply because it s actually pretty complicated today  so if you want to write a word in written english  you have to use one of the 26   letters   of the alphabet  well if you want to say a word in spoken english  you have to use one of the 40 basic   phonemes   of phonology  you could reduce a phoneme to the syllables to understand better but there is more than that to it actually  so in theory  if a computer could recognize all phonemes of spoken english  like storing them in the hdd and the computer would just make the comparison   he d be able to understand what you say  if we d speak slowly with the same pronunciation  it s gonne work  but hey  everybody s unique so we need to complicate it a bit  like you said the issue is pronunciation  accents  fluency  fillers  so  we are adding more and more complexity to the software  so today  voici recognition software uses statistical  pattern recognition techniques to help them understand what you are saying  this are really complicated for example if you say  thank dew   your computer because it s been programmed to understand that   generally   you put  you  after  thank   you meant  thank you   this are called   hidden markov models    the last improvment made in this field is that in order to better personnalize your voice recognition software  you generally go threw a   training phase    so the software is built with classic dabatabes of phonemes  statistical grammatical structures of the language  dictionnaries  to personnalize it  they ll make you read pre  saved phrases then they ll correct the bases phonemes using your own voice  you can now understand how complicated it can get  well  the future will be even more  the next step is called   artificial neural network   which is in the main lines a computing model that is able to recognize patterns and making the machine learn  it s actually pretty old but it s been in the last decade that we made some really incredible discoveries in the field  they are litterally making a computer learn a language allmost from scratch with all its words and grammatical structures  etc  this is pretty high level  but here is a good tutorial on hidden markov models to speech recognition url0,0
if a body part was exposed to the vacuum of space it would be very dangerous the vacuum of space is a very harsh environment and it is not meant for humans to be in if a persons shoulder was exposed to the vacuum of space the air in their body would quickly escape through their shoulder causing their body to expand this could cause their skin to stretch and tear and it could also cause their blood vessels to burst after a few seconds the persons body would become cold and they would lose consciousness without air to breathe they would not be able to survive for very long it is important to always make sure that your space suit is properly sealed when you are in space to protect yourself from the harsh environment,1

some anthropologists believe that mongoloids  chinese  japanese  pacific islanders  eskimos  etc  evolved to have less hair to keep clean while wearing heavy clothes and furs during the ice age  having less hair allowed them to be clean for longer periods of time without bathing  the cleaner you are  the more likely you ll get to have sex  it s an evolutionary benefit of paedomorphism  edit  i m not claiming this is true  i m just saying that s what some anthropologists believe  i remembered reading or hearing about it somewhere and found this in wikipedia  url1 which sources this  url0 a few people object to the term mongoloid  because it can be used in a derogatory way  but the term is still in use in an anthropological sense to describe peoples that migrated through siberia and eventually became east asian  southeast asian  pacific islander  native american  etc  i apologize for using that term  but i really do nt know of a more pc term that is equivalent  basically  many of the distinguishing features of east  asian people have recently been linked to a single gene mutation  these include  smaller boobs  less hair  more sweat and tighter  larger eye  lids  it is believed that the reason this new gene variation succeeded was because it makes you sweat more  so you have better heat regulation  whether this helped you survive until sexual maturity   and therefore pass on the gene   or made you more sexually attractive   maybe ancient oriental folk liked a sweaty betty   is left up to your own speculation  source  url0 therefore  speculation about why east asian people look the way they do is largely inaccurate as it seems to be all linked to the survival and prosperity of a single gene  allele  therefore there may be no environmental  reason  why they have narrower eyes  it is merely a side effect of an otherwise useful gene  edit 1  when i say  less hair   it is actually thicker hair but more sparse  also  here is a better link  url1 edit 2  after lurking for years  this is the second thing i ever posted on reddit  so i feel like a boss right now  thank you for the mild validation  edit 3  it makes me feel powerful to add edits  also i am 25  british  and my girlfriend of 6 years is filipino  in case that is relevant to anyone  edit 4  to the op u  h04 i trust that you mean no harm and are simply seeking knowledge about a sensitive subject  but i strongly recommend you never say  the yellow race  again  also  the very nature of you question is somewhat racist in its structure  comparing  arabs  to  asians  is making 2 single statements about over 2 billion people  there is great genetic diversity in these groups and no one thing can be accurately said about either  you are looking for a reason but that is the cool thing about genetics  sometimes there is no reason  some people who had less body hair had lots of sex and their kids did the same thing and their genetics became the dominant set in a somewhat isolated subset of humans    reasons    everything everyone says in this regard is a total guess ,0

well its actually really hard to create software that cant be hacked or cracked software is made by people and people make mistakes sometimes they make mistakes on purpose like when they want to make it easy for people to use the software without paying for it hacking and cracking is when someone takes advantage of those mistakes to do things theyre not supposed to be able to do they might change some of the code or add their own code to make the software do something it wasnt supposed to do software companies try their best to make their software as secure as possible but its always possible that someone will find a way to hack it thats why its important for software companies to keep working to make their software more secure and for people to be careful about downloading and using software from unknown sources,1
if 40 of the remaining 60 loan to value ltv ratio is not paid it means that the borrower has not paid a total of 40  60  100 of the loan this means that the borrower has defaulted on the loan and the lender may take steps to recover the unpaid amount such as by repossessing any collateral that was used to secure the loan or by pursuing legal actionif the borrower wants to take only 60 of the loan it means that the borrower is requesting a loan for only 60 of the value of the collateral used to secure the loan in this case the lender may be willing to provide the loan as long as the borrower meets the lenders other requirements such as demonstrating an ability to repay the loan and providing adequate collateral to secure the loan,1

from my understanding  when you go to sleep your senses do not  turn off   you are still hear  feel  smell  taste  and see the backs of your eyelids like when you are awake  but when you are sleeping your brain  tunes it out  as unimportant  so when something wakes you up  the stimuli has already been processed and can be passed on to your conscious thoughts  i mean  in ancient times  it would be important to immediately know if a sound was lion and you needed to run now  there are layers to the depth of sleep  just like falling asleep is a slow process  so is waking  after 5 minutes your in a light phase  nrem1  but after 20mins your probably in a much deeper stage called nrem2 where body temperature decreases  breathing rate slows and other metabolic functions slow down  then nrem 3  which typically happens after 40mins  brain waves are very large and slow  most noises will not wake you and if you are awoken you will be discombobulated  if this happens in middle of night you will not remember  lastly  the deepest stage is the rem stage where rapid eye movement irregular breathing  heart rate occurs and of course lucid dreaming  the brain waves paradoxically are fast and sporadic like when awake but most of your muscles are paralyzed  these four stages cycle through and the last deepest rem stage gets longer with each successive cycle  the last rem sleep occurs and lasts about 60  90 mins before waking  then you return to the light stage where sleep is easily disturbed  also  the biorhythm for the stress hormone cortisol reaches its highest levels upon waking which makes you jittery  prompting arousal  cortisol is lowest at night  that coupled with highest melatonin levels make you sleepy  you can increase ability to enter and duration of the deep restorative stages of sleep by keeping regular schedule and doing exercise  so  to directly answer your question  sometimes you can identify the particular sound that initially jolted you enough to knock you up to a lighter stage  then you roll around until boredom  dopamine and stress levels cause you to get out of bed  alarms stress you out maximally  if you are in deep sleep you may hate the alarm and have trouble falling back again unless really sleep deprived  if in nrem1 and rested  probably you ll be happy to get up  in sensory deprivation tanks  which de  stress people they must play music and increase volume gradually to wake the person up  also  deaf people have things they put on their eyes with bright flashing lights  or vibrating accessories  or programmed thermostat to heat up room at certain time   you can see these are analogs to sunlight  feeling and body temperature returning to normal  a further question  why do some things wake us up  but not others  for example  my mother comes and goes into my room at night and i never wake up  but if a wasp flies near me  i ll jump the fuck up out of a cold sleep  can our bodies still detect what s normal and what s dangerous while we are asleep  can we determine what s normal and what s out of the ordinary ,0
because when you delete a file  the file is nt erased  files are stored on the hard drive by a file that says  oh  file abtxt  that s located between this space and that space on the drive   the program then goes and loads up the information between this space and that space and  ta  da  abtxt loads up  all deleting a file does is deletes the label  it d be like if you had a filing cabinet full of file folders  and in these file folders were the files you wanted  everything in the file cabinet is unlabled  hanging off the file cabinet is the big book of files  looking in the book  you can see that in drawer 5  folder 5  8 is stored the johnson case file  when the johnson case file is deleted  someone just erases the entries for drawer 5  folders 5  8 in the big book of files  then when tom comes in needing space for the kirkpatrick files  he looks in the book and sees that the next avaliable space is  drawer 5  folders 5  10  he only needs 5 folders  so he writes down that drawer 5  folders 5  9 are the kirkpatrick files  he opens the drawer  sees that there s something in folders 5  8 and  just throws it away as garbage before storing his shit  a file recovery program is a program that ignores the big book of files and just digs around in the unlabled folders  it then takes what it finds and compares it to the big book of files  and reports to you anything it found that was nt in the book  to restore it  all it has to do is write in that the file can be found at the following locations  this is also why the restoration program can sometimes see a file was there  but not restore it  in my example  where folders 5  8 were being used  let s say the next file only needed 5 and 6  7 and 8 are still the original file  but there s not enough data there for the recovery program to fix it  when you  delete  a file  you re just telling the computer to forget that it s there  and use the space  when it needs to   the computer does nt go and wipe that section of hard drive  because that would be a waste of time  it just overwrites whatever s there the next time it needs the space  that means you can retrieve the file after you ve told the computer to delete it but before it s put anything else there  if you want to delete something securely  you can tell the computer to delete  and  overwrite it  let s say you work at a used car lot  you brother  in  law calls and tells you he is coming in to buy that red honda he s had his eye on  so you put a sold sign on it and wait for him to come in  but before he make it in  a customer sees the car and  really  wants it  offering twice what your brother  in  law would pay  you decide it is too good to pass up  and you walk away with a nice commission  that s basically what is happening on the hard drive  when a file is deleted  you computer is just putting a available sign on the file  it is still there  some time down the road  that space might be used for something else  but until it is  you can get the file back ,0
it wo nt  it will cause a recession in the oil industry  and a recession in those nations that that industry is a major part of the gdp  like russia  but not a global one  it will also not cause a recession in the us because the oil industry is about 2  of our gdp  maybe not a big recession  falling gas prices will have a big impact on  everything  prices of everything should see a bit of a drop this year because of the reduced cost of shipping  this will affect areas that produce oil though  i live western canada and we were never really hit that hard by the recession in 2009 because of our growing oil and gas  and mining industry  over the last year we ve seen coal prices fall through the floor and now we are watching the oil industry wash down the drain  we took the big hit from the coal prices already  lots of coal mines shut down already and a few i believe are still just winding down  next will be oil and gas  alberta will be hardest hit by that and we ll see a  massive  loss in jobs  the result in the massive loss of jobs in alberta will be that many of these people will no longer have money to spend in the local economy  so businesses suffer  also rig workers are notorious for overspending and taking out loans for lots of toys like big trucks and snowmobiles  soon we will see these workers failing to pay their loans  we ll then see them try to sell all their shit to pay off debt  as a result prices of used cars  trucks and other  toys  will plummet  further hurting businesses who will have a hard time competing with the crazy cheap used market  this may also cause a large housing sell off  laid off workers might not be able to afford those either  and a resulting massive drop in housing prices  i do nt think this will cause a  global  recession but its really going to hurt for some of us  because most people that have money make it by owning things that a lot of people need and use that are hard to get or that there is a very limited amount of  oil is one of those things  since there is usually a limited supply of oil the people who extract and refine it can charge a lot of money for it  but if there is suddenly a whole lot of it  like right now  then the price goes down and all of those people who were planning on it being hard to get suddenly ca nt charge people as much as they would like to  what this means is that those people that were planning to make a lot of money are making less money and as a result they are likely to spend less money or spend their money less freely  less money from the rich means less money for everyone since they have 80  of all of the money and resources on the planet ,0
im guessing since i dont know the term but it sounds like youre asking about the technique whereby a loan is used to gather multiple years gift allowance into a single upfront transfer for the subsequent n years the giver pays the installments on the loan for the recipient at a yearly amount small enough to avoid triggering gift tax you still have to pay income tax on the interest received even though youre giving them the money to pay you and you must charge a certain minimum interest or more accurately if you charge less than that they tax you as if the loan was earning that minimum historically this was used by relatively wealthy folks since the cost of lawyers and filing the paperwork and bookkeeping was high enough that most folks never found out this workaround existed and few were moving enough money to make those costs worthwhile but between the great recession and the internet this has become much more widely known and there are services which will draw up standard paperwork have a lawyer sanitycheck it for your local laws file the official mortgage lien not actually needed unless you want the recipient to also be able to write off the interest on their taxes and provide a paymentsprocessing service if you do expect part or all of the loan to be paid by the recipient or whatever subset of those services you need  ive done this in my case it cost me a bit under 1000 to set up the paperwork so i could loan a friend a sizable chunk of cash and have it clearly on record as a loan not a gift the amount in question was large enough and the interpersonal issues tricky enough that this was a good deal for us obviously run the numbers websearching family loan  will find much more detail about how this works and what it can and cant do along with services specializing in these transactions note if you are actually selling something such as your share of a house this dance may or may not make sense again run the numbers and if in doubt get expert advice rather than trusting strangers on the web go not to the internet for legal advice for it shall say both mu and ni,0
looking into someones eyes does not mean staring intently into their face for 15 minutes  eye contact is amazing  but you can over  do it  this is probably your problem  it depends upon the culture you re raised in  in some places  making eye contact is the norm  and comfortable for people  in others  it is considered rude unless you are very familiar with the other person  ultimately  it probably boils down to humans being very visually oriented  especially men  with the human gaze a frequent part of the mating ritual  for example  how do you get the attention of someone you re interested in from across a crowded bar  by making eye contact  so  there s probably an underlying sexual connotation to sustained or intense eye contact that people might not even be aware of  but it s there  and it can cause awkwardness and discomfort  there are two primary reasons why animals would maintain eye contact with another member of the same species  1   hey  you look good  i m going to get closer to you   2   hey  you look scary  i m intimidated and should back off    or    hey  you look vulnerable  i m going to take advantage  eat  you   how we were raised and where we grew up are important factors that affect this behaviour  however  making eye contact ultimately boils down to one of those criteria above  if another person is staring at us with the intent of eating us  doing harm to us  or having sex with us  and we do nt feel the same way  our primal instincts naturally would induce a sense of distress  think of two strangers staring into each other s eyes and think of a couple staring into each other s eyes  the strangers do nt want to have sex each other  hopefully   the couple  however  do  i believe many terrestrial animals also behave the same way  correct me if i m wrong ,0
raw files are a type of image file that is created by digital cameras they contain all of the information that was captured by the cameras image sensor when you took a photo this includes things like the colors brightness and other details of the imageevery camera manufacturer uses a different file extension for their raw files because they all use different software to process the information in the files for example canon uses the extension cr2 for its raw files while nikon uses nef and sony uses arwthe contents of the raw files are generally the same between different cameras but they may be organized or structured differently this is because different camera manufacturers may use different algorithms to process the raw data from the image sensor into a finished imagein general raw files are considered to be higher quality than other types of image files because they contain more information and have not been processed as much this makes them ideal for editing and postprocessing but they can be larger in size and may require specialized software to open and view them,1

it is not safe or healthy for anyone to consume bodily fluids including semen as there are various sexually transmitted infections stis that can be transmitted through contact with bodily fluids therefore it is important for people in the adult film industry to practice safe sex and use barriers such as condoms and dental dams to reduce the risk of sti transmission even with the use of barriers there is still a risk of infection so it is important for adult film performers to regularly get tested for stis and to inform their partners about their sti status nit is also not uncommon for people in the adult film industry to experience nausea or other unpleasant side effects after performing certain acts this is because what might be sexually arousing or enjoyable in a private setting may not be as enjoyable or comfortable when being filmed or watched by others it is important for people in the adult film industry to take care of their physical and emotional wellbeing and to communicate with their partners about their boundaries and limits,1
the correct way to say it is a european not an european the reason for this is that the sound of the word european begins with a consonant sound not a vowel sound in english we use the article a before words that begin with a consonant sound and we use the article an before words that begin with a vowel sound for example we would say a cat because the word cat begins with the consonant sound k we would say an apple because the word apple begins with the vowel sound a the vowel sound at the beginning of the word european is actually made by the letter y which is a consonant the letter y makes a vowel sound when it is used as a consonant as in the word yes in the word european the y makes the vowel sound ee which is a consonant sound therefore we use the article a before the word european,1

signal processing is the study of operations that modify or analyze signals a signal is a representation of a physical quantity or variable such as sound images or other data that conveys information signal processing involves the use of algorithms to manipulate and analyze signals in order to extract useful information or to enhance the signal in some waynnnnthere are many different types of signal processing including digital signal processing dsp which involves the use of digital computers to process signals and analog signal processing which involves the use of analog circuits and devices to process signals signal processing techniques can be used in a wide range of applications including telecommunications audio and video processing image and video analysis medical imaging radar and sonar and many othersnnnnsome common tasks in signal processing include filtering which removes unwanted frequencies or noise from a signal compression which reduces the size of a signal by removing redundant or unnecessary information and transformation which converts a signal from one form to another such as converting a sound wave into a digital signal signal processing techniques can also be used to improve the quality of a signal such as by removing noise or distortion or to extract useful information from a signal such as identifying patterns or features,1
most us banks dont allow you the ability to draft a foreign currency check from usd though i know canadian banks are more workable for instance td allows you to do this from cad to many other currencies for a small fee i believe even as a us citizen you can quite easily open a td trust account and youd be good to go also at one time zions bank was one of the few which lets us customers do this addhoc and there is a fee associated even as a business you cant usually do this without jumping thru hoops and proving your business dealings in foreign countries most businesses who do this often will opt to using a payment processor service from a 3rd party which cuts checks in foreign currencies at a monthly and per check base your other option which may be more feasible if youre planning on doing this often would be to open a british bank account but this can be difficult if not impossible due to the strict money laundering antifraud regulations many banks simply wont do it but you might try a few of the newer british banks like tesco virgin and metro,0

as jerzidevil said  spontaneous human combustion is controversial and unproven  spontaneous combustion  however  is very real  i was out of work several months due to it  most combustion requires three things  fuel  heat  and oxygen  fuel provides the energy  heat starts the reaction  oxygen releases the chemical energy in the fuel by combining with it  but oils are a little odd  occasionally  an oil molecule will combust  by itself  with no additional heat source apart from being at room temperature or slightly warmer than that  evan edible oils do this  if memory serves  this is what gives old food oils a rancid flavor  and this is what happened at a place i worked at  we typically soaked up excess deep fryer oil with large burlap rags  these rags would go into a simple cloth hamper  wads of fabric crumpled up in a bag  creating multiple air spaces  and  here and there  a molecule of oil spontaneously combusts  99 times out of a hundred  i guess  nothing bad happens  but once in a while  the combination of multiple air spaces and the insulating properties of the fabric means that as the occasional molecule of oil spontaneously combusts  the warmth this produces slowly builds up  as it gets warmer  more molecules of oil spontaneously combust  the increase in warmth speeds up  the bundle of rags gets warmer  and perhaps a bit of convection comes into play  bringing fresher air into the bundle as the warmer air rises  the heat continues to build  and build  and now a great many oil molecules are spontaneously combusting until the bundle of rags reaches flash point and  bursts into flame   so   always  store greasy rags in a sealed  fireproof container  food oil  petroleum oil  does nt matter  it s only an alleged condition  there is no empirical evidence that shc is actually real  from what i have read  most cases that have alleged shc were in fact simply people who most likely died from some other cause  heart attack  maybe  and their body was near a fuel source like an open flame or candle  and ended up knocking over or interfering with the fuel source and set themselves or their carcasses on fire  everything i ve seen and read about suggets strongly that the concept is the product of mistaken forensics  there is  to my knowledge  no evidence that living beings can spontaneously combust in the way that breathless tv shows may suggest  the flawed forensics are  however  based on very real evidence that s pretty compelling  it s generally accepted that short of a blast furnace  it s very hard to reduce human tissues to what s been found at some of these scenes  and that s where the idea arose from  because there seemed to be no good explanation  experiments on pig carcasses eventually provided some insights that offer a likely explanation  people are usually dressed  and many fabrics can provide a wicking effect to burning matter  human tissues wo nt burn aggressively in open air  but can so so under fabrics they re in contact with  achieving the much higher temperatures needed to produce the substantial reduction found in many of the documented cases of alleged shc  what s probably happening is that someone loses consciousness in the vicinity of an open flame or other random source of combustion  unable to react to ignition and the spreading fire  they simply burn  the way the pig carcasses did  in their clothes or whatever s on them  and that wicking effect produces these very dramatic reductions ,0
i have no idea what the traditional accounting way of dealing with this might be but does your accounts package has the concept of subaccounts within a bank account  if so to me it would make sense that when a cheque is written you move money in the accounts package from the bank account to a subaccount named cheques written then when it is cashed move money from that subaccount to the supplier  then from a reporting perspective when you want a report that will correspond to your actual bank statement run a report that includes the subacconut when you want a report that tells you how much you have available to spend rune  a report that excludes the subaccount,0
sodium chloride also known as table salt is the most common salt used in food because it is a very versatile ingredient that is inexpensive and easily available it can be used to add flavor to food help preserve food and improve the texture of certain dishes there are other types of salt that are safe to eat and can give different taste sensations but they are not as commonly used because they may be more expensive or harder to find for example himalayan pink salt which is mined in the himalayan mountains is often used as a finishing salt because it has a unique flavor and a pretty pink color sea salt which is made from evaporated seawater is another type of salt that is used in some dishes because it has a slightly different flavor than table salt overall while there are other types of salt that can be used in cooking sodium chloride is the most commonly used because it is widely available and works well in a variety of dishes,1

the laffer curve is a graphical representation of the relationship between tax rates and government revenue it suggests that there is a certain point at which increasing tax rates will result in decreasing government revenue because high tax rates may discourage people from working and investingthe laffer curve has been controversial because it is difficult to determine exactly where the curve peaks and because it relies on assumptions about how people will respond to changes in tax rates some economists argue that the laffer curve is overly simplistic and does not accurately reflect the complexity of the relationship between taxes and economic activitydespite these criticisms the laffer curve remains popular among some conservatives because it is often used to argue that lowering tax rates can lead to increased economic growth and government revenue this argument has been influential in shaping tax policies in many countries,1
emcâ² is a famous scientific equation that tells us the relationship between energy mass and the speed of light the equation says that energy e is equal to mass m multiplied by the speed of light c squared this equation is important because it helps us understand how energy and mass are related to each other it tells us that mass and energy are two forms of the same thing and that they can be converted into each other for example if you have a lot of mass like in a heavy object you also have a lot of energy stored inside it the equation also tells us that the amount of energy stored in an object increases as the objects mass increases so a small amount of mass can contain a lot of energy and a large amount of mass can contain even more energy emcâ² has changed our world in many ways it has helped us understand how the sun produces energy and it has also helped us create new technologies like nuclear power plants and particle accelerators it has also helped us understand how the universe works and how energy and matter are related to each other so in short emcâ² is an equation that helps us understand the relationship between energy mass and the speed of light it has had many important applications in science and technology and has helped us understand some of the most fundamental aspects of the universe,1
they make more money using those supercomputers to be google last year alone google made over  10 billion in profit  the entire value of every single bitcoin in circulation at current prices works out at about  14 billion  therefore even if google had mined bitcoins from the very beginning and somehow managed to keep hold of every single one of them  it s still only the same amount of money as they get from just two months of normal trading  in other words  google makes billions and billions of dollars by doing what they already do  why should they stop doing that and start using their computers to do something else which will actually be less profitable for them  for one  google needs it processing power for lots of other stuff  stuff that is more profitable and better for google s reputation  on top of that  there would nt be enough market for google to sell all the bitcoins they could mine if they used all the capacity they had  they would drive the prices down so low that it is no longer profitable for them ,0
its not necessarily true that someone who is making extra efforts to socialize with someone is deemed lame or a loner people can have different opinions and attitudes towards socializing and making efforts to connect with others some people may appreciate and value being contacted and spending time with others while others may not its important to remember that everyone is different and has their own preferences and boundaries when it comes to socializing its not productive or kind to label someone as lame or a loner just because they have different social habits or preferences than you do its always a good idea to be respectful and considerate of others and their feelings regardless of whether you agree with their choices or not,1

there are several reasons why the price of an investment may only be updated once per day one reason is that the market for the investment closes for a period of time each day and the price is only updated when the market reopens for example stock markets typically close at 400pm eastern time and do not reopen until the next business day during this time the price of a stock will not changeanother reason why the price of an investment may only be updated once per day is because the investment is not traded on a continuous basis some investments such as mutual funds and exchangetraded funds etfs are priced at the end of the trading day based on the value of their underlying assets the price of these investments is typically only updated once per day after the market closesits also possible that the platform or service you are using to track the price of your investment only updates the information once per day in this case the investment itself may be traded more frequently but the platform is only showing the most recent price at the end of the trading dayif you need more uptodate information on the price of your investment you may be able to find it on other financial websites or by contacting the company or organization that manages the investment its important to keep in mind however that the price of an investment can change rapidly and may not always be immediately reflected in the information that is available the price of an investment is typically only updated once per day because it reflects the closing price of the investment on a particular day the closing price is the price at which the investment is traded at the end of the day after the market has closedthere can be fluctuations in the price of an investment during the trading day but these fluctuations are not reflected in the closing price until the next trading day this means that the price of an investment will only be updated once per day at the end of the trading daythere are some exceptions to this rule for example some investments such as futures contracts and options may have prices that are updated more frequently additionally some investments may have prices that are updated in realtime such as certain types of equities that are traded on electronic exchanges however these types of investments are relatively rare and are not the norm,1
ncameras take photos using a lens which is a piece of glass or other transparent substance with curved sides for concentrating or disseminating light rays or radiation to form an image the aperture is an adjustable opening in the lens that controls the amount of light that passes through to the cameras sensor which is the part of the camera that captures the imagennthe aperture is usually round because this shape allows for the most efficient use of light and produces the most pleasing bokeh which is the aesthetic quality of the blur in the outoffocus parts of a photograph a round aperture also allows for more flexibility in adjusting the amount of light that passes through the lens as the size of the opening can be easily variednndigital cameras differ from older film cameras in a few ways one of the main differences is that digital cameras use a digital sensor to capture images while film cameras use film to record the image digital sensors are made up of tiny lightsensitive cells called pixels which record the light that passes through the lens and create an electronic representation of the image film cameras on the other hand use chemical reactions on the film to record the imagennanother difference between digital and film cameras is that digital cameras can store and display the images they capture electronically while film cameras require the film to be developed and printed in order to see the images digital cameras also offer more flexibility in terms of adjusting settings and editing the images as the images are stored electronically and can be easily manipulated using software,1

it is not possible for me to provide specific advice on the best course of action for settling a house during a divorce without more information about your individual circumstances however there are a few general considerations that may be helpful to consider when trying to decide how to proceedwhat are your financial goals and needs if one spouse wants to keep the house and the other wants to sell it it may be necessary to consider the financial implications for each person this could include factors such as the mortgage property taxes and potential sale price of the housewhat are your emotional ties to the house if the house holds a lot of sentimental value or has a lot of memories associated with it this could be an important factor in deciding whether to keep or sell the propertywhat is the market value of the house if the house is worth significantly more than what is owed on the mortgage it may make more sense to sell the property and split the proceeds however if the house is worth less than what is owed on the mortgage it may make more sense for one spouse to take on the responsibility of paying off the remaining debtultimately the best option for settling a house during a divorce will depend on your individual circumstances and the terms of your divorce agreement it may be helpful to consult with a financial advisor attorney or other professional to help you make an informed decision,1
smell is caused by molecules that are released into the air by certain objects or substances these molecules travel through the air and eventually reach your nose where they are detected by special cells called olfactory receptorswhen you smell something its because these molecules have entered your nose and interacted with the olfactory receptors the receptors send a signal to your brain which interprets the signal as a particular smellsmell does not radiate like sound but rather it travels through the air in the same way that gases do when you open a bottle of perfume for example the perfume molecules will escape from the bottle and start to spread out through the air they will continue to spread out until they reach your nose or some other object that they can stick toso to summarize smell is transmitted through the air by molecules that are released from a source these molecules travel through the air and are eventually detected by your nose which sends a signal to your brain that is interpreted as a particular smell,1

i  and other shareholders were part of a startup bank  that was formed in the late 90 s  it sold in 2013  it took 10 million to start it  and a ton of regulatory approval  and a board that had to be approved by the feds  and a staff that had to be approved by the feds  it was a massive challenge to keep afloat  especially when hundreds of banks failed between 2007  2009  regulatory burden  compliance  fdic insurance  and competition  will kill you if you tried to start a bank as a normal person  realistic answer  never gon na happen in this current financial and regulatory environment  but  to answer your question of  how   get a bunch of people with a bunch of money  have them put it all into a pot  write a massive report for the feds to consider approval  get approval  find a building  find a staff  and start loaning out money and taking deposits  then  survive nearly annual visits from the feds who will look into every nook and cranny of your business  price your loans cheaper than the competition  and pay hundreds of thousands to information technology folks  insurance companies  internal auditors  software and hardware vendors  and myriad other people and voila you have a functioning bank  a bank needs capital to start offering loans  and people generally wo nt want to deposit their money in a bank that seems unstable or unprofessionally managed  you need to have some experience in finance  having done high level work for banks before and preferably some formal education  if by  normal  person you mean middle class  you do nt have the capital to start a bank  so you need to get major investors that like your ideas and are willing to provide capital  for credit unions  you may be able to get members of your target community to pledge deposit funds en masse  but that s hard to do if there are already a lot of banks available  in short  the circumstances have to be just right  creating a bank is nt something you do overnight  and it s rarely something you do alone  to some extent it requires having your own capital  ie  being rich  or at least being able to convince people who do  it certainly is nt something you can go into as an amateur  there is a sentiment in the comments here that you have to have incredible wealth to be a part of a start  up bank  this is simply not true  there are typically a few large investors  but community banks will often sell stock to round out their equity  meaning an investment of  50000 or less  sounds like a lot  but you do nt have to be billionaire to invest in a local bank ,0
in general distributions from an inherited ira are subject to income tax however the specific tax treatment of the distribution depends on the type of inherited ira and the relationship of the beneficiary to the original account holderif the inherited ira is a traditional ira the beneficiary will generally have to pay income tax on the distribution at their own tax rate however if the original account holder was taking required minimum distributions rmds at the time of their death and the beneficiary is a spouse the spouse may be able to roll the inherited ira into their own traditional ira and continue taking rmds in this case the distributions would be taxed as ordinary incomeif the inherited ira is a roth ira the beneficiary will generally not have to pay income tax on the distribution as long as the original account holder had held the account for at least five years however if the original account holder had not held the account for at least five years the beneficiary may have to pay income tax on a portion of the distributionif the beneficiary is not the spouse of the original account holder they may have to use the fiveyear rule or the life expectancy rule to calculate the tax treatment of the distribution under the fiveyear rule the beneficiary must withdraw all of the funds in the inherited ira within five years of the original account holders death under the life expectancy rule the beneficiary can take distributions from the inherited ira over their own life expectancy as determined by irs tablesits important to note that these are general rules and there may be other factors that affect the tax treatment of an inherited ira its always a good idea to consult with a tax professional or financial advisor to determine the specific tax implications of an inherited ira in your situation distributions from an inherited ira are generally subject to income tax but the tax treatment can depend on a few factors including the type of ira that was inherited and the relationship of the beneficiary to the original account holderif the inherited ira is a traditional ira the distributions are generally taxable as ordinary income the beneficiary will report the distribution on their tax return and pay tax at their marginal tax rateif the inherited ira is a roth ira the distributions are generally taxfree if they are qualified distributions to be qualified the distribution must be taken after the owner of the roth ira has held the account for at least five years and the distribution must be takenafter the owner reaches age 59 12on account of the owners deathbecause the owner is disabledif the inherited ira is a roth ira and the distribution is not qualified the distribution may still be taxfree to the extent that it consists of the owners contributions but any earnings on those contributions will be subject to income taxits important to note that the rules for inherited iras can be complex and may vary depending on the specific circumstances its a good idea to consult with a tax professional or refer to the irs website for more information,1

its not accurate to say that so many people hate the french or that the rest of the world is prejudice against them while it is true that some people may harbor negative feelings towards france or the french it is not fair or accurate to generalize about the attitudes of entire countries or groups of people there are many different reasons why someone might dislike or have negative feelings towards a particular country or culture in some cases these feelings might be based on misunderstandings or a lack of knowledge about the country or culture in question in other cases negative feelings might stem from historical conflicts or differences in cultural values it is important to remember that every country and culture has its own unique strengths and weaknesses and it is not productive or fair to make blanket judgments about a country or its people based on stereotypes or prejudices it is always better to try to understand and respect the differences between cultures and to treat others with kindness and compassion,1

there are a few different ways to organize this but mostly i think you need to talk to a lawyer  the 5050 split thing should be in writing along with a bunch of other issues you could have one of you doing a sole proprietorship where the other person is a contractor that receives half of all revenuesprofits  the person that owns the sole proprietorship may be entitled to deduct certain costs of running the entity  the other person would then be 1099d his share of revenues you could set up a partnership again legal paperwork is necessary you could also setup an scorp where each of you is a 50 owner you could also setup an llc that is organized as any of the above  i would only do this if you can self fund some additional tax preparation costs  figure about 600year at a minimum   there are a lot of options with a sole proprietorship being the easiest  your first step on the new venture would be to apply for an ein free and then opening a business bank account good luck,0

sure let me see if i can explain this in a way that is easy to understand quantum mechanics is a theory that helps us understand how very small things like atoms and particles behave it is very good at explaining the strange and weird things that happen at the tiny scales of atoms and particles general relativity is a theory that helps us understand how gravity works it explains how things like planets and galaxies move and behave and it is very good at explaining the way that large things move and behave now the strange thing is that these two theories dont always work well together for example when we try to use both theories to understand what is happening inside a black hole they give us very different answers this is one of the biggest mysteries in physics and scientists are still trying to figure out how to make these two theories work together does that make sense,1
great question a e i o and u are considered vowels because they are the most common sounds that we make with our voices when we want to say a word they are different from consonants because consonants are made when we use our mouth and voice to block the flow of air as we say them for example when we say the consonant b we use our lips to block the flow of air but when we say the vowel a we dont block the flow of air at all  we just let it flow freely through our mouths does that help,1

sure sigmund freud was an austrian psychiatrist and neurologist who is known for his theories about the psychological structure of the human mind according to freud the human mind is divided into three parts the id the ego and the superego the id is the part of the mind that is responsible for our basic needs and desires such as hunger thirst and the desire for pleasure it is the most primitive part of the mind and is concerned with immediate gratification the ego is the part of the mind that is responsible for our conscious thoughts and actions it is the part of the mind that helps us to deal with reality and make decisions based on what is practical and realistic the superego is the part of the mind that is responsible for our sense of right and wrong and our moral standards it is the part of the mind that helps us to control our impulses and make decisions based on what is morally right so to summarize the id is the part of the mind that wants pleasure and immediate gratification the ego is the part of the mind that helps us to deal with reality and make practical decisions and the superego is the part of the mind that helps us to control our impulses and make moral decisions,1

the value of money also known as its purchasing power can decrease for a variety of reasons one common reason is inflation which is an increase in the overall level of prices in an economy when prices rise each unit of currency is worth less so it takes more money to buy the same goods and services for example if the inflation rate is 2 per year and the price of a particular item is 100 today that item may cost 102 a year from now due to inflationanother reason why money may lose value is due to changes in the demand for or supply of a currency if a country experiences economic downturn or political instability demand for its currency may decline causing its value to fall relative to other currencies similarly if a countrys central bank increases the supply of its currency too quickly it can also lead to a decline in the value of the currencyin addition to these factors the value of money can also be affected by external events such as global economic trends or changes in the exchange rate between different currencies,1

the equation for an inflationadjusted annuity held in perpetuity isa  r  iwherea is the annual payment of the annuityr is the real rate of return on the annuityi is the inflation ratean annuity is a financial product that provides a stream of payments over a period of time typically in exchange for an upfront payment an annuity held in perpetuity means that the payments continue indefinitely into the futurean inflationadjusted annuity is an annuity that is designed to maintain its purchasing power over time by increasing the annual payment in line with the rate of inflation this is achieved by setting the real rate of return r to be higher than the inflation rate ifor example if the real rate of return on an annuity is 3 and the inflation rate is 2 the annual payment of the annuity a would bea  3  2  15this means that the annual payment would be 15 times the initial payment the payment would increase each year by the rate of inflation to maintain its purchasing poweri hope this helps let me know if you have any questions the equation for an inflationadjusted annuity held in perpetuity ispv  a  rwherepv is the present value of the annuity which is the value of the annuity at the present timea is the annual payment received from the annuityr is the discount rate which is the rate at which the future payments from the annuity are discounted to present value this rate should be adjusted for inflation to reflect the purchasing power of the payments at the time they are receivedto calculate the present value of an inflationadjusted annuity you need to know the annual payment the discount rate and the expected rate of inflation you can then use the equation above to calculate the present value of the annuityfor example suppose you have an annuity that pays an annual payment of 10000 and you expect the rate of inflation to be 2 per year if you use a discount rate of 4 to reflect the time value of money the present value of the annuity would bepv  10000  004  250000this means that at the present time the annuity is worth 250000,1
reincarnation is the belief that the soul or consciousness of a person is reborn in a new body after death this belief is held by some religions and spiritual traditions but it is not a universally accepted idearnrnaccording to the belief in reincarnation the number of souls in the world remains constant and when a person dies their soul is reborn into a new body this means that the population size does not change as a result of reincarnationrnrnhowever the overall population size of the world does change due to other factors such as the birth and death rates of people in a particular place in some cases the belief in reincarnation may be used to explain why certain people are born into certain circumstances such as being born into a wealthy family or being born with a disabilityrnrnits important to note that the concept of reincarnation is a belief and is not supported by scientific evidence different people have different beliefs about the nature of the soul and what happens to it after death and there is no one definitive answer to these questions,1
traffic congestion moves in waves backward from the source  if traffic stopped a few miles up the road an hour ago  the wave will have moved backward  and when you arrive at it  there will be no visible source for the problem  someone used their breaks  basicly  when someone breaks to reduce speed 5 miles per hour  the next person experiances a delay  and then has to over compensate  slowing down much further  and then speeding back up to the new velocity  this spike can get transferred various distances depending on congestion  when there is a lot of congestion merely using the break  will often cause others to break  even if you are nt really being slowed  which then creates a jam  this is made even worse by people being defensive  aggressive drivers  in places where there is no carpool lane  when one wants to just drive and tune out  one tends to drive in the right lane which also happens to be the lane people are merging into  and that lack of the drivers on the highway giving way causes it  because now to get on the highway before you get shot back off into minor streets you have to floor it  and go significantly faster or slower  than the traffic you are merging into  only aggressive drivers are paying so much attention that the would be able to swerve into a different lane instead of hitting their breaks  but most people just do nt feel that engaged with the driving experience  the solution is of course to have the farthest left lane be a  tune out  lane which is for people who use cruise control  and passing  the next lane would be the fastest lane  and progressively slower  there does nt even have to be a reason  just has to be slightly busy and you can get a jam  url0,0

there are pros and cons to both options so it ultimately depends on your individual circumstances and prioritiesif you buy a home and leverage roommates youll be responsible for all of the costs associated with owning a home such as mortgage payments property taxes insurance and maintenance however you may be able to offset some of these costs by renting out rooms to roommates this can be a good option if youre able to find reliable roommates and youre comfortable sharing your home with others it can also be a good way to build equity in a home which can be a good longterm investmenton the other hand if you split rent with roommates youll only be responsible for your share of the rent and you wont have to worry about the other costs associated with owning a home this can be a good option if youre not ready to commit to owning a home or if you dont want the responsibility of being a landlord however you wont be building equity in a home and youll have to move whenever your lease is up or if you want to live somewhere elseultimately the right choice for you will depend on your financial situation your longterm goals and your personal preferences its a good idea to carefully consider your options and think about what will work best for you before making a decision,1

after world war i the countries in western europe were trying to rebuild and recover from the damage and loss of life that had occurred during the war they were also trying to prevent another war from happening to do this they made a treaty called the treaty of versailles which limited the size and power of the german military so that it couldnt start a war againnnhowever the german leader at the time adolf hitler did not agree with the treaty of versailles and wanted to build up the german military again he also had a plan to take over other countries and expand the territory of germany many people in other countries did not believe that hitler would try to start a war and they did not take his threats seriously they were also busy with their own problems and did not want to get involved in another conflictnnwhen hitler began to invade other countries many of them were caught off guard and were not prepared to defend themselves they did not have strong enough armies or enough weapons to fight back against the welltrained and wellequipped german military as a result germany was able to sweep across much of europe and take control of many countries with little resistance,1
image stitching is a technique used to combine multiple images with overlapping fields of view into a single larger image this is often used in photography to create panoramic images or to extend the field of view in an image it can also be used in other applications such as creating virtual tours or 360 degree imagesnnnnimage stitching involves aligning the overlapping images adjusting for any differences in exposure or color and blending the images together to create a seamless final image this process can be done manually using software tools such as photoshop or it can be automated using specialized image stitching softwarennnnimage stitching requires careful alignment of the images to ensure that the final result looks natural and seamless this can be challenging due to variations in perspective lighting and other factors that can affect the appearance of the images however with the right tools and techniques it is possible to create highquality stitched images that are virtually indistinguishable from a single wideangle photograph,1
yes thats correct water at the bottom of the ocean is more dense than water at the top because of the pressure imagine you have a big jar full of water if you put a rock at the bottom of the jar the water will push down on the rock with a certain amount of force this force is called pressure now imagine that you put the same rock at the top of the jar the water will still push down on the rock but there will be less water above it so the force or pressure will be less the same thing happens in the ocean the water at the bottom of the ocean is under a lot of pressure because there is a lot of water above it this makes the water more dense which means there are more molecules packed into a certain space on the other hand the water at the top of the ocean is under less pressure so it is less dense i hope that helps do you have any other questions,1
a programmer is someone who writes code to create programs or applications a software engineer is a type of programmer who focuses on the design and development of software systems they may be involved in the entire software development process from gathering requirements and creating a plan to testing and maintaining the finished product one key difference between a programmer and a software engineer is the scope of their work a programmer may work on a specific piece of a software project such as writing code for a particular feature or fixing a bug a software engineer on the other hand may be responsible for the overall design and architecture of a software system and may work with a team of programmers to ensure that the finished product meets the required specifications the projected outlook for software engineers is higher because there is a growing demand for professionals who can design and develop complex software systems this may be due to the increasing importance of software in a variety of industries such as healthcare finance and technology i hope this helps to explain the difference between a programmer and a software engineer if you have any more questions please feel free to ask,1

antiskip technology on the sony discman works by using a sensor to detect when the cd player is being bumped or jostled when the sensor detects movement it sends a signal to a microprocessor which then tells the cd player to temporarily store a few seconds of music in memory this way if the cd player is bumped the music will continue to play without skipping for a few seconds when the cd player is no longer being bumped it will start reading music from the cd again does that make sense,1
because it s utterly pointless  the absolute maximum solar irradiance at the earth is 1360 watts per square meter  by the time you get through the atmosphere  and by the time you consider that most solar panels are well under 50  efficient  you re talking about 500 watts per square meter of electricity  on a clear summer day  roof and hood of a car is what  3 square meters  so that s 1500 watts  which is 2 horsepower  that s roughly the power that a push lawnmower or a drill has  it s certainly not enough to power your car  which likely has over 100 horsepower  it would maybe be enough to trickle charge your car  roughly 50 minutes of charging would give you 1 minute of driving   if you worked an 8 hour day and had a commute under 10 minutes  it  might  charge enough during the day to get you home  but you d still need to charge it from a socket once you re home  as it wo nt charge in the dark  not to mention  you re also dragging around additional weight due to the solar panels  if you consider that the average car uses 100hp to move 1500 kg  that s 15 kg per horsepower  if your solar panels weigh 30 kg  they ve negated their benefit  as they re generating the same power that the car is spending to move them  even if they weigh less  it could be a net loss  since you d be carrying them around in the dark too  and this is all assuming that solar panels are free  when you consider that they re not  any semblance of a good reason to have them disappears  you re far better off just putting solar panels on the roof of your house and getting a car that supports plug  in recharging  it would nt be enough energy to power the car  liquid fuels are still one of the most dense forms of energy we have available  even while we move towards electric cars  it ll be a much longer time before you can have something like an electric airplane because the energy  kg for liquid fuel is just so much better than a battery  basically  we need to get a better way to store the energy if you want to have a practical application for solar panels on cars  our battery technology really has changed too fundamentally in the last 50 years  if you had an electric car  it might save you a few bucks over the course of a year from your recharge bill but the cost of the panels would cost more than you would save  even after 5 years  your car is simply too small and not angled properly at all times in order to make an economical dent ,0

in computer science the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform thus the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to be related by a constant factornsince an algorithms running time may vary among different inputs of the same size one commonly considers the worstcase time complexity which is the maximum amount of time required for inputs of a given size less common and usually specified explicitly is the averagecase complexity which is the average of the time taken on inputs of a given size this makes sense because there are only a finite number of possible inputs of a given size in both cases the time complexity is generally expressed as a function of the size of the inputu200a226u200a since this function is generally difficult to compute exactly and the running time for small inputs is usually not consequential one commonly focuses on the behavior of the complexity when the input size increasesâ€”that is the asymptotic behavior of the complexity therefore the time complexity is commonly expressed using big o notation typically nnnnonnnnnnndisplaystyle onnn nnnnonnnnlognu2061nnnnnndisplaystyle onlog nnn nnnnonnnnnnî±nnnnnndisplaystyle onalpha nn nnnnonnn2nnnnnnnnndisplaystyle o2nnn etc where n is the size in units of bits needed to represent the inputnalgorithmic complexities are classified according to the type of function appearing in the big o notation for example an algorithm with time complexity nnnnonnnnnnndisplaystyle onnn is a linear time algorithm and an algorithm with time complexity nnnnonnnnnnî±nnnnnndisplaystyle onalpha nn for some constant nnnnî±nn1nnndisplaystyle alpha 1nn is a polynomial time algorithm,0

when you re little  if you give baby food and chocolate to a baby  it will probably prefer chocolate because it s  stronger  to his taste buds  but since it is a baby  he is nt used to strong flavors  so it can eat bland foods as well  that s why when you have a baby  you do nt introduce salt and sugar right away  because you want them to get used to every food  every flavor and not to prefer the  bad  ones  as you grow  you start to put more salt in food  or more sugar  and those who do nt have any of these components  or very little  seem very bland to you  coincidentally  that s why old people put too much salt on food  they tend to lose taste and put more of these components  what seems strong to you  may seem rather bland to another person depending on habits and age  you also do nt have anything to compare it to  as you get older  you eat better food and all the things you ate as a kid are gross by comparison  taste buds mature  it s only the same developmental process wherein lassie  dunston checks in  or blank cheque are no longer great films to you ,0
nthere are a few reasons why other countries might not use air ducts for central air conditioning as commonly as they are used in north americannone reason is that air ducts can be expensive to install especially in older buildings where they might not already be in place ductless air conditioning systems on the other hand are relatively easy to install because they dont require the installation of air ductsnnanother reason is that air ducts can be inefficient as they can lose a significant amount of cool air due to leaks or improper insulation ductless air conditioning systems are generally more efficient because the cool air is delivered directly to the room or area that needs to be cooled rather than being sent through a network of air ductsnnfinally some people prefer the flexibility and control that ductless air conditioning systems offer because they are installed directly in the room or area that needs to be cooled they allow you to customize the temperature and airflow in each individual space rather than relying on a single central system to cool your entire home or buildingnnoverall while air ducts can be an effective way to distribute cool air throughout a building they are not the only option and there are many other factors that can influence the choice of an air conditioning system such as cost efficiency and personal preference,1
the closer to human something looks  the more we like it until it gets too close  the whole thing comes from the traits we re looking for  for example  let s look at  flubber   url0    the incredibles   url2   and  neo from the crappy cgi scenes in the matrix 2   url1   we like things that are nt human but have human traits and recoil from things that have human traits but are nt human  it depends on what is more prevalent  flubber is obviously not human  but we like when it grows appendages and dances like a human  it s cute  it s funny  it s good  it thinks it s people  yay  the incredibles are human  sort of  i mean  just look at the wide variety of body part shapes you see  a real human with those proportions would most likely have some serious health issues  yet  because these representations of people have human traits on outlandish bodies  we look for what makes them human instead of what makes them not human  finally  poor  poor  cgi neo  he s supposed to be human  but has something  off about him  he s supposed to be an actual human that passes by us without questioning his humanity  but we can see little things about him that do nt look just right  so we really do nt like it  flubber is not human  gets human triats  we look for humanity in it  incredibles are characters that look human  ish  we look for humanity in them  neo is supposed to be the real deal  we look for problems in him  when you get too close to being human  we start looking for problems with the subject instead of its human traits  since we ve seen so many real humans  those problems really stand out  no matter how subtle  and bug the shit out of us  tldr  our brains can tell something is wrong with what we re seeing  but we ca nt quite figure out what it is  you watch a cartoon  it looks like a cartoon and it looks fake  and it s enjoyable  and you watch a show with actors and they look real  and it s enjoyable  but what if someone created a show using cgi that looks like actors  but for some reason they do nt seem real and you do nt know why  this is show falls into the uncanny valley  this can happen with anything that our brains have perceived a lot of  we see certain things very frequently  walking  facial expressions  and even things like blinking at regular intervals  our brains  without us thinking about it  can tell when something is  wrong   but we do nt necessary know what it is  here is an example of walking with uncanny valley  looks good  but something is wrong  url0 tldr  it s the point where something looks very much like a human  but is still undoubtedly not human and this makes you uncomfortable  the uncanny valley is the point where something tries to look human but is flawed in some ways  their eyes might look dead  the lips form in a weird shape  we know what a human looks like and this is definitely not human  and that feeling of  something is wrong about this  is what creates the uncanny valley and makes it uncomfortable  this first came about with the creation of human like robots  people responded well whenever the robots got more human like features like eyes and lips  but when they started to try and make these features look as much like a real human then the people responded with general uncomfortable feelings  they did nt want to look at it because it was wrong  since then animation has made lots of improvements and it can be found in animation as well  it s why cartoons and anime tend to exaggerate human features  they need to look human enough  but not to much so that people get uncomfortable with them  big eyes  ridiculous hair  a chiseled chin  it s all ridiculous but we like it  but start making everything look real and you can tell that it s just wrong  you would nt want to look at it for extended periods of time  you get uncomfortable  tip  use the uncanny valley to your advantage if trying to tell a creepy story or doing a d  d campaign or something   a man approaches you at the bar  he asks for your help with something  as you talk to him you ca nt help but study his face  you feel at unease  you ca nt help but to glance at certain parts that look  off  but you just ca nt put your finger on what is wrong  it must be your imagination  ,0
an itch is a feeling that you get that makes you want to scratch a part of your skin itches can be caused by many different things such as insect bites dry skin allergies or infections nwhen something touches or irritates your skin it sends a message to your brain through nerve fibers your brain then interprets this message as an itch and you feel the urge to scratch scratching can help to relieve the itch because it can help to remove the thing that is causing the irritation or it can stimulate certain nerve fibers that can help to block the sensation of the itch nsometimes you might get an itch even when there is nothing touching your skin this can be because of things like dry skin stress or certain medical conditions nin general it is a good idea to try to resist the urge to scratch an itch too much as scratching too hard or too often can damage your skin and make the itch worse instead you can try using a gentle lotion or cream to help moisturize your skin and reduce the itch or you can try taking a warm bath or using a cool damp cloth to help soothe the itch,1
he was thinking  as we are wo nt to do  and figured that he would start with the most basic thing possible  he ll start with the basic and then work from there  what can we know for sure  he figured that there are a lot of options  maybe we re all being tricked by a devil  or ill  or living in a matrix  style world  or hallucinating  or whatever  but if we think  if we perceive  if we wonder  if we ponder  then we necessarily exist  we could nt think if we did nt exist  so that s the starting point  we can go from there  descartes was practicing a form of rhetoric in which he stipulated doubt for anything that could not be conclusively proved  despite this  he came to the conclusion that the self  and therefore consciousness  must exist  because what other entity could conceive of its own non  existence  specifically  he wonders if the world he perceives is real  first  he wonders if god is real  and concludes he has no evidence that supports such an assertion  next  he casts doubt on the idea that the physical world he perceives through through sensory input is real  it could be the result of a malicious demon tricking his senses  so things that we  know exist  because of our experience seeing  touching  hearing  or smelling them are not sufficient for descartes s model  descartes then questions the existence of his own body  and can not be convinced of its existence either  ultimately  he settles on a theory of mind and determines that the mind is the only thing that can be conclusively proved   i think  therefore i am  represents a mind independent of a body  brain  or the sensory realm asserting itself as an extant thing  this is a huge development in the understanding of human consciousness  this argument becomes the foundation for cartesian dualism  the idea that the soul  sometimes also called the mind  is distinct from the body  what he s saying is  there s more to being human than the physical bits of which we re composed  since he sees no compelling evidence that the  mind  he s using to think about his own existence is connected to the physical matter that makes up his own being  this question ends up getting debated for a very  very long time  we still do nt really know if the physical state of the brain  or body  can be reproduced or altered in a physical way to create such phenomena as memories  ideas  beliefs  or wills  ultimately   i think  therefore i am  is an assertion that human consciousness exists independently of the metaphysical ideas we use to talk about it  and uses doubt as a form of proof  because how can something that  does nt exist  question its own existence  no philosopher here  but i interpret that it s about consciousness and self  awareness  you can recognize that other things exist easily through touch  sight  and other senses  but how do you recognize that you yourself exist  in your entirety  sure you have a body and your senses can interact with it too  you can touch it  see it   and hopefully not too strongly  smell it  but that body can be dead or in a coma  or you could lop a fingernail clipping off of it and that would be a sensed object  and those things would still exist without the driving force that is  you   descartes observes that the process of thought  and further  the recognition of the ability to think  is an important step in full recognition of the existence and self  awareness  because i  theoriginalretro  think  i exist as an individual conscious entity  further  because i  recognize  that i am thinking  i am a  self  aware  individual conscious entity  it s quite the neat little saying ,0
the minimum age for early retirement depends on the country and specific retirement program you are using in the united states for example the minimum age for early retirement under social security is 62 years old however if you retire at this age your benefits will be reduced the full retirement age which is the age at which you are eligible to receive full retirement benefits varies depending on the year you were born for those born between 1943 and 1954 the full retirement age is 66 for those born in 1960 or later the full retirement age is 67in some countries it is possible to retire even earlier than the minimum age but this may also result in reduced benefits in general it is important to carefully consider the financial implications of retiring early as you may not receive the same level of benefits as you would if you waited until the full retirement age it is also a good idea to consult with a financial planner or retirement specialist to determine the best course of action for your specific situation,1

ok  impulsive people make decisions without thinking through the consequences   decisive people make a decision after having thought through the consequences  they are differentiated from indecisive people in that an indecisive person will use thinking it through as an excuse not to make a choice  so of the 3 classes of people  decisive  think things through then decide  indecisive  think things through and do not decide  impulsive  do not think things through but still decide   spelling edit   equals the difference between good judgement and a car wreck  i think a lot of it comes down to luck and good information though  steps of decisiveness   look at situation from all angles  decide on course of action  follow through with decision confidently steps of being impulsive   i just bought a new car ,0
primaries are run by the parties  not by any formal government process  they are used to determine the best candidates to elect to run for their party in the general election  there s no legal requirement to do it this way and many people run in the general election who never went through a primary  it s worth noting that the american system for electing a president is not a direct vote either  the system is a representative system when a smaller body of people vote as representative of the broader populace  that s the electoral college  you directly vote for congress  indirectly vote for the president  and representatively appoint supreme court justices via the president  it s all intentionally different  most of the democratic republics of the world do not let their voters choose party candidates  when the uk parliament votes no confidence  the countries  parties have already selected their leaders  and those people are the candidates for the next prime minister  in the us  on the other hand  primary elections were part of the progressive movement of the late 1800s  early 1900s  the idea was to take power out of the hands of party bosses and give it to the people  by giving voters input into party choices  primaries   never   completely surrendered the power of the party bosses  and this years  primaries have illustrated that in stark black and white  where party bosses right and left have tried mightily to thwart the clearly and repeatedly contrary desires of the voters  if anything  the republicans have capitulated to their rebellious voters  and are reluctantly accepting trump  meanwhile  the democrats are still fighting the bitter fight  watch  the ides of march  sometime  great movie  gives you a glimpse into politics and presidential elections  now more importantly  regardless of what we re led to   believe    delegates   claim   to vote for the party  nominee that   their people   want  politics and elections are just business  people  delegates are going to vote for whoever can give them a better position  more money  some kind of career  related advantage  and you can bet your ass that delegates and super delegates all have friends that can pull electoral votes as long as everyone is  getting a piece of the pie   the people do not vote for the president  the people are voting for a middle man that will claim to vote the way you d like them to ,0
calcitonin is a hormone that is produced by the thyroid gland a butterflyshaped organ located in the neck it is produced by special cells called c cells or parafollicular cells in the thyroid gland calcitonin plays a role in regulating the balance of calcium in the body by decreasing the amount of calcium released from the bones into the bloodstream it is secreted in response to high levels of calcium in the blood and it helps to maintain a normal range of calcium levels in the body by reducing the activity of boneresorbing cells called osteoclasts calcitonin is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland specifically by a group of cells called c cells it is released into the bloodstream in response to high levels of calcium in the blood and it acts to lower the levels of calcium by inhibiting the breakdown of bone and increasing the excretion of calcium in the urine calcitonin is also involved in regulating blood pressure and has a role in the immune system in humans calcitonin is typically produced in small amounts and is thought to play a minor role in calcium homeostasis compared to other hormones such as parathyroid hormone calcitonin is a hormone that is produced by the thyroid gland specifically by a group of cells within the thyroid called c cells or parafollicular cells calcitonin plays a role in regulating the levels of calcium and phosphate in the blood and in bone metabolism it is released into the bloodstream in response to high levels of calcium in the blood and it works to lower these levels by inhibiting the breakdown of bone and increasing the excretion of calcium in the urine this helps to maintain normal calcium levels in the body which are important for proper muscle function nerve transmission and other physiological processes,1
debt comes from different sources besides bonds  but i understand those best  springfield ohio wants to do what s best for the people that live there  so they decide to build a hospital and upgrade the roads  this will create some permanent jobsincreasing tax revenue  save some lives and possibly attract people to move there instead of other places without a hospital  but they do nt have the millions of dollars to build this now  and of the city waits to build a hospital  people with the means to move will leave to greener pastures  so they issue municipal bonds that pay a small interest rate  in the long run the city and its residents are better off  the bond buyers make some money off the interest  at a bigger level a state will have bonds for bigger projects like bridges and the federal level has t billstreasury bills  the end result being that the debt amount is unimportant as long as the city takes in more tax money as a result  this effect is more severe because there is a huge benefit to being the best  silicon valley is a great example of this  a lot of great companies started there and now a lot of highly paid taxpayers live there  on the federal level as long as the gdp increases taking on more debt is a net gain financially  our interstate sytem cost billions of dollars but it allows the united states to conduct business in a way that other places can not  governments want to buy new shit so they look good to voters  and possibly defraud a bit on the side  too  and their successors  not them will have to pay it  no wonder they borrow a lot  it s logical  personal debt is normally not good  sovereign debt  the debt of countries themselves  is in general not that bad  why do you think it s bad ,0

it s called  pareidolia   url0  i read somewhere that it s a very basic instinct for humans  and other mammals  i d guess   the idea is that when we are first born  we need to recognize our mother  even before we can fully use our eyes  so there is a  built in  notion of what a face looks like   oval shape  two eye etc    so since we have this instinct in our dna  we tend to recognize or see faces in all sorts of places  also  this could be an explanation of why people who report seeing  aliens   always seem to come up with a similar description  oval head  two large eyes   it s because this image is already in their subconscious  so when they go on a moonshine binge and mess up their brain  they remember this instinctual image  but do nt know why  im not saying it s aliens but   humans are hard wired to recognise another human  it s a survival tactic so we can discern friend from foe esp in poor conditions ie the jungle for example ,0

yes and no  your mind is built in software for the hardware of your brain  as the hardware expands the software gains complexity but accidents  and manufacturing defects  that harm the brain will limit the scope and ability of the mind to function optimally  the brain is the engine  the mind is the movement  you probably already know what the brain is  the mass of cells inside your skull  defining what  mind  is is kinda tricky  first of all  the metaphor of brain  mind as hardware  software is a deceptive one  most cognitive scientists will tell you to steer away from this type of thinking nowadays because it s way too simplistic and naive  and ultimately wrong  moreover  thinking of the mind as software and the brain as hardware hinders further research in both computer science and neuroscience  i can tell you more about this if you want to know  but i ll hint at it below  so what is the  mind   contemporary cognitive science  or the science that does study the mind and cognition  has quite a few followers who suggest that the mind is more than the brain   mind includes the body and how the person s body is   url1  and there are some who would say the  mind  is not just the brain in a body  but  also   a brain in a body in the world     url0   someone who has bipolar disorder does not have a  hardware malfunction   there is no  software  that can make a  hardware problem  better or go away  but  unlike the computer metaphor  the mind  can  make even the synaptic structures of the brain to change  today we do nt speak of nature vs nurture  but nature and nurture  our environment and how we interact with it does change our brain  albeit  to a certain extent   as a cognitive scientist myself  i would say the mind is not the software of the brain  hardware  the mind is that interaction between the brain  which is in a body which perceives the world in a certain way  and which is situated in a particular historical  cultural  social context ,0
in some regions the forecast is very accurate  where it is not  there are two main reasons  1  microclimate  the temperature is forecast for a specific location  such as downtown or the airport  a few miles away  due to mountains or bodies of water  the weather may work differently  2  lack of data  most weather systems move from west to east  and most weather monitoring stations are on the ground  so forecasters on the west coast are at a disadvantage  with no cities far west of them  the source you are looking at should tell you what it means  it could be referring to yesterday s actually measured high and low  which of course are not incompatible with the current temperature being outside that range  as it is not currently yesterday   or to the predicted high and low for today which was predicted at some point in the past  yesterday  last week   where the predictions are wrong  or if you are measuring the 37 yourself  it could just be that you are doing it wrong  or your location is colder than it is at the airport or wherever the official weather station is for your area  high and low are the actual temperatures  sometimes they are not accurate but most places they are  if your local region has bad accuracy then it is likely due to a lack of data on the local microclimate ,0
a timing belt is a part of an internal combustion engine that synchronizes the rotation of the crankshaft and the camshafts so that the engines valves open and close at the proper times during the engines operation in other words the timing belt is responsible for ensuring that the engines valves open and close at the proper times in relation to the position of the pistons this is important because if the timing is off the engine will not run properly and may suffer from reduced performance or even fail completely the timing belt is typically made of a strong flexible material such as rubber or kevlar and is driven by the engines crankshaft it is located within the engine and is usually hidden by other engine components a timing belt is a mechanical component that is found in the internal combustion engines of many vehicles it is responsible for synchronizing the rotation of the crankshaft and the camshafts so that the engines valves open and close at the proper times the timing belt is driven by the engines crankshaft and in turn drives the camshaftsnnthe timing belt is an essential part of the engine as it ensures that the valves are opening and closing at the right times in relation to the position of the pistons if the timing belt were to fail or break the engine would not run properly and could suffer serious damage in some engines the timing belt is located inside a protective cover and is not visible from the outside in other engines the timing belt may be visible and can be accessed for maintenance or replacementnnit is important to regularly inspect and maintain the timing belt as it can wear out over time and may need to be replaced the manufacturer of the vehicle will usually provide guidelines for how often the timing belt should be replaced which is typically around 60000 to 90000 miles failing to replace a worn timing belt can lead to costly engine repairs or even engine failure a timing belt is a component of an internal combustion engine that synchronizes the rotation of the crankshaft and the camshafts so that the engines valves open and close at the proper times during the engines cycle the timing belt helps to ensure that the engines pistons and valves are moving in the correct sequence and timing which is necessary for the engine to operate efficientlynntiming belts are typically made of a strong flexible material such as rubber and are reinforced with fibers to increase their strength and durability they are typically located inside the engines timing cover and are driven by the crankshaft with the other end connected to the camshaftsnnin some engines the timing belt is responsible for driving other engine components as well such as the water pump and oil pump the timing belt is typically replaced at regular intervals as part of routine maintenance to ensure that the engine continues to operate properly,1

the swiss franc is actually too strong verses other currencies right now  this sounds like it would be a good thing and too a degree it is but switzerland relies on exports as a major part of its economy and if no one can afford your exports then you have problems so they wanted to cap the value of the franc verses the euro at 12 euros per franc  now capping your currency on paper is one thing but actions is louder than words so they feel they have to enforce this by buying the crap out of currencies in an effort to make the market do what they want it to do  the idea is  we set the cap  now we are going to buy currencies and make the currency market follow what we are doing  maybe not quite at the 5  year  old level  but here s a good podcast about this topic  url0 and a blog post  url1 the gist is that because of all of the uncertainty in the markets  a ton of investors have been buying up the swiss franc over the last couple weeks drastically inflating its price and making their exports too expensive  how much does one who lives it switzerland earn   could you work in switzerland buy currency and retire in america like a king ,0
their mass is so small they reach terminal velocity very quickly due to the resistance of the air they are falling through  they land quite slowly compared to how fast a human dropped from 500 ft would land  their smaller mass also means that they have less of themselves to stop suddenly and their bodies do nt crush themselves  the scale assumption you have is incorrect  a bug dropping from 5 feet is experiencing the same downward force from gravity as that of a human jumping from 5 feet  there are terminal velocity and physical reasons why a bug can survive higher distances than a human  but just be aware that the size scale is nt the right way to think about it  tl  dr  small and large things fall at the same rate  url0 a better way to look at it is that things do nt scale up  if you made a human size version of the bugs and dropped them from a proportional hight they would die  small mass wind resistance small hight,0
i think its because its an emulsifier  there is a hydrophillic end which is attracted to the water and a hydrophobic end which is attracted to the dirt  this keeps the water and dirt together and since the water is easy to get off your hands the dirt just goes with it  as far as the foaming  or lathering  i think that is due to the soap containing foaming agents like sodium dodecyl sulfate  do nt quote me on this  it s just my basic understanding  maybe someone else can give a more accurate and detailed response  background  things that readily dissolve in water  like salt  are called hydrophilic  things that push water away  like oil  are called hydrophobic  and hydrophobic things will readily interact with each other  detergents  soap  are long molecules that have both a hydrophilic end  and a hydrophobic end  so  if you were to wash your hands with just water  you would be able to remove anything that was hydrophilic  which would dissolve in the water  and anything that was loosely attached that could be mechanically removed by scrubbing or the flow of the water  soap grabs the hydrophobic things  like oils and fats  with its hydrophobic end  and then attaches them to the water with it s hydrophilic end so they can get washed away with the water too  edit  foam occurs because the detergent molecules also interact with each other  the hydrophobic ends all line up next to each other opposite the hydrophobic ends forming a membrane  this is very similar to how cellular membranes are structured    as you agitate the soap  water mixture  you add air which the detergent membranes forms around  just like blowing bubbles  a doctor friend once told me the primary function of soap is to lubricate your hands so that unwanted particles are easier to remove when water is applied  primarily  the water is what actually cleans your hands  while the soap just makes it easier for the water to do its job ,0

einsteins theory of special relativity is a theory that explains how objects move and how time and space work it tells us that the speed of light is always the same no matter how fast you are movingnnimagine you are on a train that is moving very fast if you throw a ball straight up in the air it will come back down and hit the ground just like it would if the train was not moving but if you shine a flashlight straight ahead the light will still travel at the same speed even though the train is movingnnthis seems strange because we usually think that things move faster when we are moving faster but according to einsteins theory the speed of light is always the same no matter how fast you are movingnnthis theory also tells us that time and space are not separate things but are actually connected for example if you are moving very fast time will seem to slow down for you this might sound like science fiction but it has been proven to be true by many experimentsnneinsteins theory of special relativity has had a huge impact on our understanding of the universe and how it works it has helped us explain many strange and mysterious phenomena and it has led to many important scientific discoveries,1

it does nt matter how fast a car can go  what matters is how fast a car can  accelerate   the more power a car has  the better a job it can do on onramps  or while passing a semi  truck  likewise  most super  fast cars like the new  corvette   url0  and the  porsche 911   url1  are built as  sport  cars   these cars are street  legal  but also competent around a racetrack  you can drive these cars to work 5 days a week  and still do sports with them on the weekends  unlike trucks  these cars do nt lug around your toys    they are the toys    i guess the real question then  is why do nt cars have speed limiters in them  my answer to that is that  ultimately  its the  driver  that is the speed limiter  if you are a good driver  than it does nt matter if your car has 125 horsepower  or 650  you wo nt speed  cut people off  or be a idiot being the wheel  if you are an idiot with one automobile  you ll be an idiot with any car you get behind the wheels of  source  scca member and racecar driver  also  i m a special little snowflake and you should listen to me  a car engine that s only powerful enough to reach about 75  80 mph would drive like a brick  you d get terrible acceleration and the engine just would nt perform as well in general  try accelerating up to 60 mph very slowly  so that it takes about a minute to get there  imagine if that was all your car could do  ever  the only way around that would be to have an engine powerful enough to go over 100  but have it artificially governed down to whatever speed they wanted  that would add significant cost to the manufacturing and be a general pain the ass for auto makers  also consider that the speed limit only applies to the average citizen driving on a public road  emergency vehicles  police  fire  ambulance  have a legitimate need to drive fast  should there be a totally different engine manufactured just for those vehicles  what about those who are volunteer fire  emt workers who drive their personal vehicles  if i m responding to a rescue call  out at 3 am where somebody s life might depend on my speedy arrival  it would suck ass to be stuck at 70 or so  speedlimit  there is no limit on my autobahn ,0
it s multi  level marketing  another redditor whose name is lost to the ages made the following astute observation    the mlm business model depends on convincing customers that they are employees    it is not legally a scam  but in all practicality it is  a more accurate term would be  convoluted scheme   at its core it s a pyramid scheme  but because it adds the tangible goods that are bought and sold part  it gets to skirt the law  basically when you become a distributor you buy amway brand household items like toilet paper and soap and you then try to sell them to people  but the rub is that this is not a very effective or smart business model  people already buy soap at the store  why would they make it complicated and buy it from you   so you are heavily redirected to recruit other people to sell under you and you get a cut of their profits  and then they recruit people  and so on  so yes  it is a pyramid scheme  but since product is changing hands the ftc leaves them alone  my opinion is that yes  it s a scam  the representatives from amway that i have had experience with made downright fraudulent representations  including fraudulently telling me how much they were making  one guy showed me his cheque from the previous month  and it was for  1000  what he did nt say was that he had to pay about  900 to his  downline  out of that  this was a guy that was considered very  up and coming  and had a successful  business   this guy worked probably 15 to 25 hours per week for what amounted to  100 profit for the month  oh  and i should mention that out of that  100  he had to pay for gas  tapes   cause you got ta be listening to tapes    countless cups of coffee while he was  showing the plan  and so on  add on extra costs such as attending the all  but  mandatory events  and almost nobody makes any money  some of amway s products are okay  but many are severely overpriced  their talking point used to be that buying  concentrated  detergent  soap  shampoo  whatever was a better value  great  but most major manufacturers sell concentrated versions of their product already  concentrated tide  check  etc  amway tells  well  used to  i do nt know what they tell people now  its people to teach people that all they need to do is find 6 people  and each of them needs to just find 6 people  and so on  and everyone will be rich  here s the problem with that  at 13 levels deep  the population of the planet has been exceeded by double  6  13 is  13 billion  so mathematically  these types of systems are built for failure  finally  do a google search on  amway cult  ,0

there are several reasons why a company might choose to go public or initial public offering iporaise capital going public allows a company to raise capital by selling shares of stock to the public this can be used to fund expansion pay off debt or invest in new projectsliquidity going public allows the founders and early investors in a company to sell their shares to the public providing them with liquidity this can be especially attractive to investors who have been holding onto their shares for a long timeincreased credibility going public can increase the credibility and visibility of a company being a publicly traded company can make it easier to attract new customers partners and employeesvaluation going public can also provide a company with a market valuation or an estimate of the companys value based on the price of its stock this can be useful for companies that want to benchmark their performance against other public companiesits important to note that going public is a complex and costly process and its not right for every company its important for a company to carefully consider the pros and cons before making the decision to go public,1

aereo was a company that allowed users to watch television channels over the internet for a small fee the company did this by setting up a network of tiny antennas that would pick up the television signals and then transmit them over the internet to the user the reason that aereo was deemed illegal by the supreme court is because the court ruled that aereo was essentially acting as a cable company but without obtaining the necessary licenses or paying the required fees to do so under the law cable companies are required to pay certain fees to the owners of the television content such as networks and studios in order to transmit that content to their subscribers by providing the same service as a cable company without obtaining the necessary licenses or paying the required fees the court ruled that aereo was infringing on the copyrights of the television content owners and was therefore illegal,1

i am the architect  i created the matrix  i ve been waiting for you  you have many questions  and although the process has altered your consciousness  you remain irrevocably human  ergo  some of my answers you will understand  and some of them you will not  concordantly  while your first question may be the most pertinent  you may or may not realize it is also irrelevant  i created the matrix  even though you have magic powers in here  you re still human  what you just asked me  neo says  who are you   is not as important as the rest of this stuff   your life is the sum of a remainder of an unbalanced equation inherent to the programming of the matrix  you are the eventuality of an anomaly  which despite my sincerest efforts i have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision  while it remains a burden to sedulously avoid it  it is not unexpected  and thus not beyond a measure of control  which has led you  inexorably  here  your powers are the result of a bug in the matrix that i ca nt fix because humans are tough to fool with a simulation and i m kind of a shitty programmer because i expect everything to be perfect  not functional  however  i ve learned to account for it  so i ve led you here as part of my catch clause   the matrix is older than you know  i prefer counting from the emergence of one integral anomaly to the emergence of the next  in which case this is the sixth version  there were 5  ones before you   as you are undoubtedly gathering  the anomaly s systemic  creating fluctuations in even the most simplistic equations  the anomaly that created you fucks with everything in the matrix at some level  remember how gravity basically means nothing to you and your friends   the first matrix i designed was quite naturally perfect  it was a work of art  flawless  sublime  a triumph equaled only by its monumental failure  the inevitability of its doom is as apparent to me now as a consequence of the imperfection inherent in every human being  thus i redesigned it based on your history to more accurately reflect the varying grotesqueries of your nature  however  i was again frustrated by failure  the first matrix was too real because it was perfect and humans are imperfect  the second one was pretty good  since it had war and stuffvampires  werewolves  etc   but failed again and i was nt quite sure why   i have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind  or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection  thus  the answer was stumbled upon by another  an intuitive program  initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche  if i am the father of the matrix  she would undoubtedly be its mother  the oracle is a program i created to understand the human soul  spirit  pysche and she helped me figure out how to make the matrix in such a way that human minds could accept it as real   as i was saying  she stumbled upon a solution whereby nearly 999  of all test subjects accepted the program  as long as they were given a choice  even if they were only aware of the choice at a near unconscious level  while this answer functioned  it was obviously fundamentally flawed  thus creating the otherwise contradictory systemic anomaly  that if left unchecked might threaten the system itself  ergo  those that refused the program  while a minority  if unchecked  would constitute an escalating probability of disaster  almost everyone is totally cool living in the matrix as long as their minds are allowed to choose between staying asleep and waking up  we totally know about zion and probably created it as a place specifically for people who rejected the matrix  you re welcome   you are here because zion is about to be destroyed  its every living inhabitant terminated  its entire existence eradicated  self explanatory   denial is the most predictable of all human responses  but  rest assured  this will be the sixth time we have destroyed it  and we have become exceedingly efficient at it  you can deny it if you want but we ve totally been through this like 5 times already   the function of the one is now to return to the source  allowing a temporary dissemination of the code you carry  reinserting the prime program  after which you will be required to select from the matrix 23 individuals  16 female  7 male  to rebuild zion  failure to comply with this process will result in a cataclysmic system crash killing everyone connected to the matrix  which coupled with the extermination of zion will ultimately result in the extinction of the entire human race  taking the code that makes you have special powers back to the source will perform a sort of reset on the matrix  for some reason  allowing us to start this whole cycle all over again without killing absolutely everyone  then  you ve got to pick some real people to repopulate zion  if you do nt  literally everybody dies   there are levels of survival we are prepared to accept  however  the relevant issue is whether or not you are ready to accept the responsibility for the death of every human being in this world  we d survive without humans  even though it might suck  but you might not be cool with being responsible for everybody dying   it is interesting reading your reactions  your five predecessors were by design based on a similar predication  a contingent affirmation that was meant to create a profound attachment to the rest of your species  facilitating the function of the one  while the others experienced this in a very general way  your experience is far more specific  vis  a  vis  love  the ones who came before you had strong feelings about humanity in general  so we picked them because they would choose the door that would save the human race  you re different because you love a  specific  human   which brings us at last to the moment of truth  wherein the fundamental flaw is ultimately expressed  and the anomaly revealed as both beginning  and end  there are two doors  the door to your right leads to the source  and the salvation of zion  the door to the left leads back to the matrix  to her  and to the end of your species  as you adequately put  the problem is choice  but we already know what you re going to do  do nt we  already i can see the chain reaction  the chemical precursors that signal the onset of emotion  designed specifically to overwhelm logic  and reason  an emotion that is already blinding you from the simple  and obvious truth  she is going to die  and there is nothing that you can do to stop it  go right  save humanity  go left  save trinity  but everybody dies  i can already tell you re going to pick the left door even though you know it s hopeless   humph  hope  it is the quintessential human delusion  simultaneously the source of your greatest strength  and your greatest weakness  aw shit  nobody ever picked left before  good luck  jerk  eli5 why smith explodes at the end  that he is screwed no matter what  basically the architect is telling neo that he has the choice of saving trinity and bring about the destruction of humankind or he can save humankind and his gf will die ,0
scientists transfer huge files in a number of ways one way is to use specialized software designed for transferring large files over the internet these programs can break the large file into smaller pieces which can be transmitted more quickly and reassembled at the other end scientists can also transfer large files using external hard drives or by sending them through the mail on physical storage devices like dvds or usb drives some scientists may also use specialized highspeed networks or cloud storage services to transfer large files overall while transferring large files can be a bit more complicated than transferring small ones there are many tools and technologies available to help scientists do it accurately and efficiently,1
football is one of the fastest games out there  the clock does nt stop  there is only one break  and if the ball goes out of play it comes straight back in again  technology is seen as interrupting the flow of the game and causing stoppages  many believe that it is the speed and intensity that the game is played at that makes it so great and therefore do not like technology being introduced  the english premier league has introduced goal line technology  however  and in a way that does little to affect the game  the ball may have crossed the line  the referee looks at his watch which will instantly tell him  if the ball did nt cross the line then play continues  because the game was designed to be judged at full speed  judging fouls and penalties is different when done at slow motion  player intentions get skewed and that s a big part of the ref s decision  imagine how every hand ball and every push off would look intentional in slow motion replay  the goal line technology is great because it does nt involve judging players  besides pace of the game  there s a lot of old school football fans that feel like the humanness of judging is part of the drama  excitement  which is why they re even against goal line technology sometimes  as it would nt interrupt the game anyways since the game is stopped anyways   do nt downvote me for this  i think it s a dumb argument too  but that is an argument i hear often ,0
i do not know the full answer but i know here are some important factors that you need to consider  do you have a physical location in the united states are you working directly from canada with a officebusiness location in the united states your tax obligation to the us is much higher most likely you will owe some to the state in which your business is located in payroll tax  your employer will likely want to look into payroll tax because in most states the payroll tax threshold is very low they will need to file payroll tax on their fulltime parttime employees as well as contractor soon as the total amount in a fiscal year exceeds the threshold related to no1 do you have a social security number and are you legally entitled to working in the states as an individual you will be receiving the appropriate forms and tax withholding info related to no3 if you dont have that already you may want to look into how to obtain permissions to conduct business within the united states technically you are a one person consulting service provider you may need to register with a particular state to obtain the permit the agency will also be able to provide you with ample tax documentations  chances are you will really need to piece together multiple information from various sources to resolve this one as the situation is specific to start look into consulting service  contractor work permit and tax info for the state your client is located in work from state level up to kick start your research then research federal level which can be more complex as it is technically international business service for canadaus,0
babies are usually referred to in months when they are younger because it is easier to understand how old they are for example if a baby is 10 months old it is easier to understand that they are almost one year old rather than saying that they are 08 years old as babies get older and reach the age of two it becomes easier to understand their age in years because they are no longer infants does that make sense,1
when you listen to a song you really like your brain releases a chemical called dopamine dopamine is often referred to as the feelgood chemical because it helps to create feelings of pleasure and happiness the release of dopamine can also cause physical sensations in your body such as chills or goosebumpsrnrnhave you ever been really excited about something and felt a tingling sensation all over your body thats a similar feeling to the chills you get when you hear a song you really like its your bodys way of reacting to the pleasurable feelings that the music is causing in your brainrnrnso in short the chills you get when you listen to a song you really like are caused by the release of dopamine in your brain which creates pleasurable feelings and physical sensations in your body,1
cartilage is nt very strong or rigid  if our legs were made out of cartilage it would make walking an interesting experience at best  cartilage is usually found either where your bones articulate  ie would be bone  on  bone  or as a connective tissue  it s used where neither the rigidity of bone nor the malleability of muscle is needed  but something in between is  it s sort of like asking why you would use rubber gaskets instead of either gel or metal  it calls for something durable but not rigid  and something flexible but not free  flowing  cartilage is more flexible than bone  when you re born  you have more cartilage than bone because you need to be bendy to get out of your mom  as you age  you need something hard and stiff to do things like walk and run  so your body replaces cartilage with bone  not all of the cartilage is replaced because there are some parts of your body that need to be bendy  like joints   or just do nt need to be stiff  like your nose   so your body does nt bother with those places ,0
in the united states you will generally have to pay taxes on your profits from trading stocks if you buy and sell a stock within a year it will be considered a shortterm capital gain and will be taxed at your ordinary income tax rate if you hold the stock for longer than a year before selling it it will be considered a longterm capital gain and will be taxed at a lower rate there are limits on how much of your capital gains can be taxed at the lower rate depending on your income you may also have to pay taxes on dividends you receive from stocks although there are some exceptions its a good idea to consult a tax professional or refer to irs guidance if you have questions about how your stock trading will be taxed,1
instruments sound different from each other because they have different shapes and sizes and they are made from different materials they also produce sound in different waysrnrnfor example a guitar has a hollow body and strings that are plucked or strummed while a violin has a solid body and strings that are played with a bow these differences in how the instruments are made and how they produce sound cause them to have their own unique tones and timbresrnrnadditionally different instruments have different ranges of notes they can play for example a guitar can typically play a wider range of notes than a violin this can also contribute to the differences in sound between the two instrumentsrnrnso even though a guitar and a violin might both be playing the same note the way they produce sound is different which is why they sound distinct from each other,1

budgeting percentages also known as budgeting guidelines or budgeting ratios are general guidelines that can be used to help individuals and households plan their spending and saving these guidelines suggest how much of your income should be allocated to different categories of expenses such as housing food transportation and savingswhile budgeting percentages can be a useful tool for helping people manage their finances its important to note that they are just guidelines and may not be applicable to everyone in all situations different people have different financial goals needs and circumstances and what works for one person may not work for anotherits also worth noting that budgeting percentages can vary from one country to another due to differences in cost of living cultural norms and other factors for example the recommended percentage of income that should be allocated to housing expenses may be higher in a city with a high cost of living compared to a city with a lower cost of livingoverall while budgeting percentages can be a useful tool for helping people manage their finances its important to consider your own unique circumstances and financial goals when developing a budget it may be helpful to work with a financial professional or to use online budgeting tools and resources to help you create a budget that works for you,1
you bought 1 share of google at 6705 while it has a current trading price of 120411 now if you bought a widget for under 70 and it currently sells for over 1200 that is quite the increase no be careful of what prices you enter into a portfolio tool as some people may be able to use options to have a strike price different than the current trading price by a sizable difference take the gain of 112206 on an initial cost of 8205 for seeing where the 1367 is coming user error on the portfolio will lead to misleading statistics i think as you meant to put in something else right,0
both of my primary home purchases were either at or close to asking price my first house was during the local sellers market in 20012002 there were waiting lines for open houses in hindsight we bought more home than we needed at the time but that had nothing to do with offering asking price it was the market for the type of property location and features at that time my second house was a little after the peak in 2008 the value had come down quite a bit and the property was priced on the low side versus the comps to this day my second house still appraises higher than what we paid for it even though it was at asking price as a third example my brotherinlaw got into a bidding war on his first home purchase and ended up buying it for above asking price this was normal for the houses in the area he was looking at with real estate like other people have said it really is important to either know the area you are looking at or to get an agent you trust and have them explain their reasons for their offer strategy through the comps yes agents need to make money but the good ones have been in the business a while and also live off of repeat business when you sell your house or refer friends and family to them agents do a lot less work when it comes to selling by the way so they would love for you to come back to them when its time to sell if im not happy with the way things are going with my agent i would have a heart to heart with them and give them a chance to correct the relationship ive spoken to a realtor friend in the past about getting out of buyers contracts and he told me its a lot easier as a buyer than a seller the buyer has most of the power during the process the seller just has what the buyer wants,0
it s not that mysterious   it causes death either through loss of blood  damage to internal organs  or infection    url0  lashing can be a bit more vigerous than you seem to imagine  picture someone getting hit so hard that it tears their skin down to the muscle  so that strips of skin are hanging off their back  if they are lashed enough they lose enough blood and skin that they will die of shock or infection from the open wound  it is nt just a few slaps with a belt that leaves a red welt or something  severe lashing  especially with a knotted or barbed whip  can break the skin in many places and cause severe bleeding  if the wound gets infected  it can certainly be life  threatening to a weakened prisoner who gets poor or no medical care ,0

i think that most people believe that this would be a pretty simple solution  when actually  it involves one of the most complex macroeconomic concepts the modern world has seen  so good question  see  in the early 20th century  we all had gold currency   now  i do nt know how well you know supply and demand  but since this is eli5  i ll make it simple   basically  this meant that international exchange rates  depend  on the exchange of gold  this implied that countries could not really control their exchange rates  the only option they had was to buy or sell gold depending on the circumstance  appreciating or depreciating the currency  now  this is nt the most efficient way of doing things  and policy  makers began to see this  the gold system meant that governments had little control over recessions  other than fiscal stimulus  raising government spending   halfway through the 20th century  leaders of the most powerful nations in the world decided on ending the bretton  woods system  the end of the bretton  woods system removed gold from the currency  this completely changed macroeconomics  now  exchange rates depend on the supply and demand  of your currency   let s describe this in a little bit more detail  we ll take the us as an example  the dollar is no longer tied to the price of gold  now  supply and demand decide the us dollar  basically  if more people demand us goods  the dollar becomes stronger  since more people want us goods  they must use dollars to get them  so demand for the currency goes up  appreciating the currency   and we  as americans  can buy more goods with it  same works for the reverse  if less people want american goods  they demand less of our currency  and the us dollar depreciates    i know this is getting long  but stay with me    the good part is coming next  now  this give the us incredible power  let s say we re in a recession  the us can purposely  depreciate its currency   why would it do this  well if the currency depreciates  more people can buy more of our stuff because it s less expensive  since our currency is cheaper to them   how does the government do this  well  it can simply supply more dollars to the world  which lowers the price of dollars  if the government does this  other countries suddenly want our goods  so our recession disappears more quickly  this is called monetary policy    phew  last part    now  what happens if we tie our currency to everyone else s currency  well  we suddenly lose that power  this is why the euro is in such bad shape  greece is in a bad situation  and normally  they could just depreciate its currency and that would help with the recession  but now  it s tied to the euro  greece can not depreciate the euro because the currency is controlled by the european union  and the european union does not want to depreciate the currency because this weakens other members of the eu  since it makes their currency less valuable and they can buy less things from the us and the rest of the world  as you can see  this means bad news bears  members of the european union are now incredibly frustrated with greece  and why would nt they be  their wellbeing is tied to greece s wellbeing  we can apply this to a world currency now  let s say japan goes through a recession  well  the us is doing well  why would the us want to devalue its currency just to help japan  monetary policy has become a very valuable tool for policy  makers  so taking that away would erase nearly a century of economic theory  edit  i now see how long this is  sorry  but i hope it s helpful  haha  edit2  all of you bringing up the bretton  woods system are right  the  end  of the bretton  woods system brought about fiat currency  thanks for the correction  ok  hmm  no one has actually attempted to explain this to a five year old  let me try  ok  so say your friend jimmy is really good at drawing  and people really want his drawings  so they re willing to give him things in exchange for his drawings  well  jimmy does nt always want what some physical thing that people have to offer  so he creates jimmy bucks  which he can spend on whatever he likes  and then people can spend those bucks on drawings  or anything else  as long as the person accepting the jimmy bucks wants jimmy s drawings   it s all working out great  everyone loves his drawings and jimmy is raking in the jimmy bucks  now  say  jimmy wants to buy a new set of paint brushes  but he does nt have enough jimmy bucks to buy his paint brushes  well guess what  jimmy can make his own jimmy bucks  before he s sold any drawings  is nt that great  he gets the exact thing he needs to make more drawings  and what he s doing is basically promising to make more drawings in the future  once he gets those paint brushes he really needs  now if jimmy could nt create his own money  he would nt be able to do that  and if suddenly there were a sudden  unpredictable drop in the number of people that wanted his drawings  he would nt be able to say  make a bunch of jimmy bucks to buy a bicycle and get a paper route  not sure if that makes sense to a five year old  but a one world currency is an awful idea  in fact  the euro is proving this point rather nicely  from what i understand from my macro theory class  which is nt much   a common currency exacerbates monetary crises like we re seeing with the eu now  while the us has over  15 trillion in debt  the majority  over 60  i believe  is owed to citizens and the government through bonds  treasury bills  more importantly the debt is in our own currency  so if it came down to brass tacks we have central control over increasing the money supply  through the federal reserve  and printing more dollars  through the treasury department   even at the risk of high inflation  with the euro  states ceded control over monetary policy by accepting a common currency  as we re seeing with greece  portugal  etc  their debt is spiraling out of control since they owe the money in euros which they have no authority over as it s delegated to the european central bank  there s   so   much more that goes into this and i m sure someone else will do a much better job at explaining the intricacies of the problem  this is just what i remember from a class i took  it should be noted that it was taught by a staunch democrat  so take that as you will ,0
because most christians are descended from gentiles  not jews  jews never really expect non  jews to follow their traditions  their holidays are more cultural than scripturally based  it makes no sense to celebrate moses liberating the jews from egypt  for example  if you re not a jew  in short  most christians are nt actually god s chosen people  so they do nt have the extra rights and responsibilities that entails  2000 years of separation can change a lot of traditions  also  once the roman empire adopted christianity  started spreading it through europe  the original cultural ties were severed  it s complicated with jews  as there are 3 elements to being a jew  race  nationality and religion  there are jews with every combination of these three elements  most jewish holidays are more national holidays than anything else so it does nt make sense for others to celebrate them ,0
when we breathe in oxygen it enters our bloodstream and is carried to cells throughout our body the cells use the oxygen to break down molecules of glucose a type of sugar and convert them into energy this process is called cellular respiration during cellular respiration carbon dioxide co2 is produced as a byproduct the carbon in the co2 comes from the glucose that was broken down during the process of generating energyso to answer your question the carbon that we exhale as co2 comes from the food that we eat specifically from the carboncontaining molecules found in the foodit is not possible to suffocate someone by starving them of carbon carbon is an essential element that is found in all living things and it is a necessary component of the molecules that make up our bodies we get the carbon that we need to survive by eating food drinking water and breathing air without an adequate supply of carbon a person would not be able to survive,1
first add the inflation then minus your expenses for the year if you are better than that you have done good  for example   1you have 10000 in 2014 2 you need 1000 for your expenses in 2014 so you are left with 9000 3 assuming the inflation rate is at 3 percent the 10000 that you initially had is worth 10300 in 2015 4 now if you can get anything over 10300 with the 9000 that you have you are in a better position than you were last year ie1030090009000  ie 1444 so anything over 1444 percent is good depending on where you live living costs and inflation may vary so please do the calculation accordingly since this is just an example cheers,0

cats are solitary animals by nature  sure  a domesticated cat will hang out with a person  but that s really because the person has taken the place of its mother and pretty much arrested the social development of the cat somewhat into the true solitary assholes that their nature makes them  dogs  on the other hand  are pack animals  and they love to please the pack leaders  which makes them much easier to train  so  in short  you can train a dog because it wants to make you happy  you can only train a cat if it wants to be trained  because cats do nt give a fuck  most cats do nt care to please their owners  they re just content with living in the same space and being given free food  because cats are just cool little motherfuckers ,0
it is a company that bets on bad things not happening to you  so health insurance  for example  a whole bunch of people pay money but the vast majority of them never get cancer so in general they companies take in way more money than they pay out  same thing with car insurance  most people never get in accidents and never make insurance claims so the money keeps piling up  lots of responses calling it a bet which is a little misleading  though all the logic  rationale is right  it s just calling it a bet is a little harsh on the industry   you  the consumer  are not betting  you are investing money in a safety net  you do nt stand to  win  anything in the bet  the insurance exists to help prevent you  losing  out  financially  as a result of something negative happening in your life  be it illness  an accident  or even death  where you are effectively providing a safety net for your dependents   the insurance company is not betting either  though they act in a similar to a bookmaker  they take on a broad spread of risks and through the use of underwriting  actuarial services they manage that portfolio of risks to ensure that they can provide the safety  net to those affected  the insurance company does nt just take on every risk  it charges higher premiums for higher risk  decline features of their products or even outright refuse the business  you are placing a bet that something bad will happen to you  you ll end up in the hospital  your house will burn down  or you ll get into an accident   the insurance agency is betting that nothing bad will happen  it s a good deal for both of you because a  the insurance is usually right nothing bad is going to happen and b  if you do nt have insurance and something bad happens  it will financially ruin you so it s usually better to make that bet and pay a consistent amount of money over time rather than try to save up the three hundred thousand dollars you d need if you crashed into someone s ferrari ,0
you could order on the phone  often  people would also walk up to the ticket stand and buy a ticket with cash on the spot  at that time  fewer people travelled by plane  so there was nt usually a big line in front of the ticket stand  edit  you could buy a ticket for a plane leaving in an hour  back in the day  when you wanted to go somewhere some people went through a travel agent  you would call them up and ask then to find you the best price  according to how many transfers you were willing to make  whether or not you wanted an early flight  as opposed to a late one  or vice  versa  if you were a frequent traveler then your agent might have your credit card number  what i would do is go and get a postal money order to pay for my ticket  i could pick up my ticket at any time after i paid for it  but i would normally pick up my ticket just before my flight at the airport  hey  i bought plane tickets in the 80s and 90s  i got this  people are right  travel agencies and calling the airlines directly were fairly common  you could also just go to the airport in advance or on the day of  in addition  in major cities  most of the major airlines had ticket offices where you could buy tickets in advance  a few of these still exist in america  though apparently not delta   and are fairly common in other countries  url0,0
x  rays  just like visible light  is electromagnetic radiation  just like how a camera captures light from a flash  an x  ray sensor capture x  rays from a  flash    just like light can go though some materials easier  thin cloth   x  rays can go through less dense materials  flesh   when light can not pass through a material  it reflects back in the shape of the image  x  rays can not pass through bones  and so reflects the x  rays back into the sensor   light and x  rays are different  frequencies  of the same radiation  light  xray beam basically  light  is shot through your body and we are measuring the different  shadows  that appear on the film as a result  except its the opposite  the things that absorb this light the most  bones  appear white on xrays and things that absorb light the least  air  skin  etc  appear black on xrays  this is because the xray beam is made of balls of energy  and every time they collide with something solid they get  attenuated   stopped  the xray film gets darker when more of these balls of energy hit it  so when you shoot through bone  a bunch of these balls of energy hit the bone and get stopped and thus the film stays whiter  depending on the density of the bone in that area you have you can have different shades of the white  so lets do a hypothetical xray of your body  in the most basic sense you have bones and soft tissue  everything else   the only thing an xray picks up on is the bones and the soft tissue  everything else  is ignored  for the most part   they shoot this beam of energized balls at your  lets say  hand  they fly directly through all the soft tissue with minimal collisions so all the soft tissue shows up pretty black on the film  because so much  light  has hit it  when the beam goes through the bone there are many different types of  attenuation   stopping of the energy balls   which is beyond the scope of an eli5  but the end result is that the particles do nt hit the film which makes the film whiter  so when you look at an xray you are basically looking at the different densities of the structures you are trying to see  which happens to work quite well when you are trying to examine bone  different frequencies of electromagnetic radiation have the ability to pass through materials of different densities  it happens that flesh is nt dense enough to stop x  rays  but bones are  if you were to increase the frequency up to  say  gamma rays  they would easily pass through both flesh  and  bone  and drop the frequency way down past the visual spectrum to microwaves  and they ca nt pass through more than a thin layer of flesh ,0
only the law stops them  it s totally feasible in practical terms  but the legal consequences  as well as the impact on their business  are deterrents  you can protect yourself by being careful where you use your card and by keeping an eye on your credit card statements  if you re a restaurant owner  sure  you could steal money from people by keeping their credit card info  this wo nt last long  though  at best you ll lose your merchant status and stop being able to process credit cards  at worst a criminal investigation  bottom line  you ll make a bit of extra money  but probably wo nt be a restaurant owner for long  it s completely possible  but not a good way to make a consistent income  which is generally what a service business owner is trying to accomplish  anyone you give your credit card into to can use it to make fraudulent charges  there are a few things which make this unlikely to happen  1  credit fraud and identity theft are serious criminal offenses 2  it is really easy to get caught 3  once a consumer notices  credit card companies can reverse the charges pretty easily 4  credit card companies can also suspend a business credit card processing privileges while a case is being investigated 5  the amount of money a business would make with fraudulent charges is small compared the punishment they would receive and the likelihood they would get away with it,0

being scared can be exciting because it gives us a rush of adrenaline adrenaline is a hormone that our body releases when we are in a situation that is exciting or stressful when we are scared our body prepares us to either fight or run away from the thing that is scaring us this can make our heart beat faster and give us a feeling of excitement some people enjoy this feeling and seek out activities that will give them a rush of adrenaline like going to haunted houses or watching scary movies its important to remember however that being scared can also be dangerous if it causes us to make poor decisions or puts us in harms way so its important to be careful and to only participate in activities that are safe and that we feel comfortable with,1
anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates for the abolition of governments and the establishment of a society based on voluntary cooperation and mutual aid anarchists believe that individuals and communities should be free to make their own decisions and that power and authority should be decentralizedrnrnone advantage of anarchism is that it allows for greater individual freedom and autonomy without a government or other authority dictating how people should live their lives individuals are free to make their own choices and pursue their own interestsrnrnanother advantage is that anarchism promotes cooperation and mutual aid in an anarchist society people would be encouraged to work together and support one another rather than relying on a centralized authority to provide for their needsrnrnhowever there are also some disadvantages to anarchism without a centralized government it can be difficult to provide for the common good and protect the rights of all individuals in addition anarchism relies on voluntary cooperation which may not always be possible or practical in certain situationsrnrnoverall anarchism is a complex and controversial philosophy that has both proponents and detractors it is important to consider the advantages and disadvantages of any political philosophy including anarchism when trying to understand how it might work in practice,1

take the long term view  build up the cash  once you have enough cash in the bank you dont need a credit score  with 6 months living expenses in the bank after paying 20 down on a small house he should have no issues getting a reasonably priced mortgage   however if he waited just a bit longer he might buy the same house outright with cash when i ran the computations for myself many years ago it would have taken me half as long to save the money and pay cash for my home as it did for me to take a mortgage and pay it off,0
it is not possible for me to diagnose a medical condition without examining the patient and obtaining a thorough medical history it is important to seek medical attention if you have a lump that is painful hot and has appeared suddenly a healthcare professional will be able to examine the lump ask you questions about your medical history and run any necessary tests to determine the cause of the lump some potential causes of a lump behind the ear could include an infection a cyst or a tumor however it is important to note that not all lumps are serious and further evaluation is necessary to determine the cause of the lump,1
debt can be a good thing for businesses because it allows them to borrow money to invest in things that will help the company grow for example a company might use debt to buy new equipment or to open a new store this can help the company make more money in the long run which can help it pay back the debt and still have some extra profits however its important for businesses to be careful with debt and make sure they can afford to pay it back if a company takes on too much debt and cant pay it back it can get into financial trouble,1

your skin contains molecules that can be synthesized into vitamin d when they re exposed to ultraviolet light  the energy from the uv light causes the molecules to change shape  allowing your body to convert them into vitamin d it just so happens that the most convenient source of uv light is the sun  there s a chemical in your skin that turns into vitamin d when exposed to uv radiation  usually colesterol molecules at skin exposure level  at stratum basale for instance  are changed by uvb radiation  once this change happens  this new molecule travels in the blood serum to the liver where it be metabolized again and distributed through the blood stream for functions like calcium absorption  melatonin regulation and so on  there are novel functions discovered recently that make it pretty relevant for depression and other cognitive functions so it is a pretty neat vitamin ,0
sure the stock market is a place where people buy and sell shares of companies when the stock market goes up it means that the value of the companies whose shares are being bought and sold has increased when the stock market goes down it means that the value of those companies has decreasedrnrnthe dow jones and nasdaq are two stock market indexes that track the value of different groups of companies the dow jones tracks the value of 30 large companies and the nasdaq tracks the value of many technology companies when the dow jones or nasdaq go up or down it means that the value of the companies in that index has changedrnrnfor example if the dow jones was down 12 points it means that the value of the companies in the dow jones has decreased by 12 points points are a unit of measurement used to track changes in the stock market,1
the way fire behaves is based on two main things on earth  gravity  and the atmosphere  air   this is evident if you  see a flame in zero gravity   url0   it s really cool  it does nt move at all  so  back to the topic at hand  the fire wiggling is because of two things  1  gravity pulls the heavy  usually liquid  as is the wax in a burning candle  fuel towards the ground  however as it burns  it undergoes a reaction and becomes mostly gas  and emits light that we see as flame  since the gas is lighter than the liquid  and the surrounding air since it s very hot  it rises up  giving flames the tall pointed appearance they have  2  the air is constantly moving around  even in tiny areas  and this moves the flame around as it rises  this causes the constantly moving  random   dance of flame   this is all moot for jet flames though  since they re pressurized in a particular direction  and unless the wind is strong they do nt  dance   this post is more li5  since the op mentioned it s her actual 5  year  old  than usual so i skip a lot of science about it  but that s basically why flames  dance  or wiggle  drakenkor is correct about the heterogeneity of the fuel source being a big factor for say wood fires vs candle flames  but i stuck specifically with candles  which do  dance  in most cases  for simplicity for an actual 5  year  old  air is moving almost all the time  that s why smoke does nt really go straight up very often  a flame is almost like smoke  just hotter  and more glowy   so it ll move along with the air in the room  heat makes air want to go upward  so the flame will also cause the air around it to move because it s hot  wood fires wiggle because of the non  homogeneous fuel source  this means that the rate of combustion is variable as the wood is consumed  this variation is visible in the  wiggling  of the fire  as the rateand also type  of burn changes  candle flames are steady  as are gas and oil flames because the fuel source is homogeneous ,0
socialism  at it s root is the idea that we all live in a society  and depend on eachother  and therefore should decide stuff together  typically  this goes beyond merely the political  for example  employees should have some say in how the company they work for should be run  parents should have a say in how the school their children attend is run  etc  wikipedia assures me that in english this is called co  determination  the next step  is that if you already depend on eachother  and decide stuff together  you have some responsibility to take care of eachother  there s dozens of variation on these basic ideas  in western europe there s a lot of social democracy  which seperates the idea of decisionmaking and ownership  so that for example employees might have certain rights to make decisions for the company they work for  but does not entitle them to a share of the profit  or to make decisions that do not directly affect their work  another type of socialism is communism  this is based on the writing of marx  and the basic idea is that the right to decide and ownership are inextricably linked  and belong to all people together  the way communism is supposed to organize this  is by people working together  sharing together and deciding together in councils  hence the name  communism    these councils  or  soviet  in russian   or their representatives  would come together in an overarching council that would make decisions for the entire country  and own everything on behalf of these councils  or at least  that s the theory  for a lot of countries  if not all  that tried to implement communism  the result was that a leader would end up being in control of the overarching council and being able to lead the local councils  rather than the other way around  which opens up lots of possibilities for abuse and general dictatorship  the reason you read a lot of conflicting definitions on terms like socialism and communism  and even capitalism  is because there really is nt an agreed  upon definition for a lot of these terms    socialism   is a very broad set of economic  political  and social ideas  some of them are even mutually exclusive  in general  however  it refers to cooperative ownership and management of the economic sphere  there are dozens of ways different socialists have suggested as ways to enact this social control   direct state control of all industry   url4   public ownership only of certain specific utilities like energy  education  or banking   private ownership but with a strong social safety net and emphasis on equality of opportunity   url1   direct worker control  such as  cooperatives   url3   operating within a market economy  or any combination of the aforementioned  these are just some examples  but they all have the same goal   the democratization of the economy   karl marx is often thought of as the founder of socialism  but in reality it was an idea much older and bigger than him  he is  however  largely responsible for the ideological weight behind communism  and developed his own vision of what  socialism  is to complement his ideas on communism   marxist socialism   url2  refers to the transitional stage between capitalism and communism    communism   refers to a classless  stateless society where nobody has to work for anybody else  yet there s plenty for everyone  no country has ever achieved communism  the soviet union considered itself a  socialist  country under the marxist understanding  meaning they thought their state socialist government was merely a temporary set  up until they achieved true communism at some point in the future  critics would argue that because the ussr did not actually allow the workers any control over industry  merely utilizing the communist party to control that industry on their behalf  that the ussr was not even a socialist country  and instead more closely resembled  state capitalism   to make matters even more confusing  communism as a concept has also been adopted by a number of non  marxists  such as  anarcho  communists   url0   who believe in the communist end goal but disagree with marx on the mechanism to achieve it  anarchism  by the way  is generally thought of as a subset of socialism   in brief  socialism refers to a very broad set of historical and modern political trends which attempt to democratize the economy and create a more egalitarian society  whereas communism is a more specific  somewhat utopian societal goal wherein the government and social hierarchy have ceased to exist  you all seem to be asking a lot about communism here ,0

if you are nt getting enough sleep then nothing will fix that  however you may simply only need 6 hours  the 8 hours rule is nt a hard line  some people need less  others need more  the main thing is that caffeine does nt  wake you up  per se  it actually inhibits the absorption of certain brain chemicals that makes your brain tired  so it s not so much waking you up as it is  keeping you from getting tired   as such  caffeine is   not   an acceptable substitute for sleep  i think you ll find that if you adjusted your sleep schedule  you would nt need the caffeine in the morning  if you ve handled it fine for the past year  then you might not be one of the people who requires the full 8 hours  and it wo nt cause any long  term effects  i would say the thing that might cause long  term side effects is your hectic schedule if you re being forced to cut sleep short ,0
carbon dioxide and water  via the chemical reaction  both are gases at those temperatures  and they fly away  do nt underestimate the mass of gases  into the air  wood is basically long chain hydrocarbons  carbon and hydrogen chains  in the heat of the fire they are broken and both carbon and hydrogen get joined to oxygen molecules from the air  you end up with carbon dioxide which is a gas  and water  h2o  which because it s hot escapes as steam  the same thing happens with food you eat and fat that you burn if you lose weight  if you do nt eat  and lose weight  fat stores are oxidised in exactly the same chemical process  releasing water and carbon dioxide which you breathe out  it s a controlled oxidation reaction that releases energy  in both cases the carbon has been released into the air   the water in the wood evaporates into the air  much of the carbon and hydrogen combines with oxygen in the air  and escapes as water and carbon dioxide  some of the carbon escapes as smoke particles,0
it costs money to build out more bandwidth  high speed routers and firewalls  fiber runs  etc  that being said most in the us are being way overcharged  to answer the actual question it is limited only by telecommunications technology which continues to grow in capabilities at a fairly rapid pace  there is not unlimited bandwidth  it is limited to what the the telecom companies can and are willing to build  edit  oh and data centers  network operation centers cost a lot of money to run as well  so no bandwidth is not free  running the infrastructure is very expensive  some switches now cost tens of thousands of dollars just to buy  if not hundreds  that said  the commercial rate for bandwidth from a data center or say amazon is maybe ten cents per gb i think  mobile is a totally different scenario though  if you are asking if there is a shortage of bandwidth and isp s need to have data caps  then the answer is no  there is zero justification for you isp to hold you to a 100 gb monthly limit or any other number  the only reason they have imposed data caps is to make more money  isp s charge what they do not because of what it costs  but what people will pay  is there a cost to implementing bandwidth  sure there is but the cost translates to pennies  if that ,0

purchasing real estate with cash is a process in which a buyer pays the full purchase price of a property in cash without financing the purchase through a mortgage or other loan this can be a good option for buyers who have a large sum of cash on hand and want to avoid the costs and complications of obtaining a mortgagethere are a few benefits to purchasing real estate with cash first it can be faster and easier to close the deal as there are no mortgage approvals or other financing contingencies to worry about additionally buyers who pay cash may be able to negotiate a lower price on the property as the seller may be more willing to accept a lower price in exchange for a faster and more certain salehowever there are also some potential drawbacks to consider for one paying cash for a property may tie up a large portion of a buyers liquid assets which could be a problem if the buyer needs access to that money for other purposes additionally paying cash for a property may not be the most financially efficient option as buyers may be able to earn a higher return on their money by investing it in other assets such as stocks or bondsoverall whether purchasing real estate with cash is a good option depends on the individual circumstances of the buyer it is important for buyers to carefully consider their financial goals and resources before making a decision,1
sure a random number generator is a program that produces random numbers these numbers should be truly random meaning that they should be unpredictable and not follow any patternrnrnproducing truly random numbers is actually quite difficult for computers because computers are designed to follow instructions and do things in a very precise and predictable way in other words computers are not very good at being randomrnrnto try to produce random numbers computer programmers have to use special algorithms sets of instructions that mimic randomness as closely as possible these algorithms use things like the current time the movement of the mouse or other seemingly random events to try to produce a random numberrnrnhowever even with these algorithms it can be difficult to guarantee that the numbers produced are truly random this is why random number generation is considered nontrivial difficult in computer programming,1
your edit indicates that you may not yet be ready to get heavily involved in investing i say this because it seems you are not very familiar with foundational financeinvesting concepts  the returns that you are seeing as yearly are just the reported earnings every 12 months which all public companies must publish those returns are not the same as the earnings of individual investors which will be on the basis of dividends paid by the company which are often annual sometimes semiannual and sometimes quarterly and by selling shares purchased previously note that over 3 months time investing in interestearning investments like bank deposits will earn you something like 05 investing in the stock market will earn you something like 2 but with generally higher risk than investing in something earning interest if you expect to earn significant amounts of money in only 3 months you will not be able to without taking on extreme levels of risk risk as high as going to a casino  safe investing takes time  years in the short term the best thing you can do to earn money is by earning more through a better job or a second parttime job or spending less budget pay down high interest debt and spend less than you earn i highly recommend you look through this site for more budgeting questions on how to get control of your finances if you feel that doesnt apply to you i encourage you to do a lot more research on investing before you send your money somewhere  you could be taking on more risk than you realize if you are not properly informed,0
it s popular to believe that a  chemical  is going to do all sorts of bad things to you while something  natural  is going to be more healthy  unfortunately  this is a load of bollocks  many natural things are harmful and everything is chemicals  some of this stems from people s belief that there s no  free lunch   it seems hard for people to accept that they can cut the calories of sugar and still get the sweet taste  it s humans playing god with nature  so something  has  to be bad about it  right  well  no  aspartame is incredibly well researched and there s no danger to the average person eating it  even in doses so large that they re just silly there s no danger  however  there are some people who can not process it  phenylketonurics  people who can not process phenylalanine  one of the parts of the aspartame molecule   this chemical can build up over their life and cause serious health risks  but that s a specific disorder and condemning aspartame because of that group would be like claiming that peanuts give you cancer because some people are allergic  the other big point that anti  aspartame individuals tend to push is the fact that aspartame breaks down into methanol  ie wood alcohol  the stuff that causes you to go blind and die if you drink it   then formaldehyde  used for embalming  and finally formic acid  also known as ant venom   this sounds absolutely  terrifying   surely science has gone too far      except it has nt  the amount of methanol you get from even an excessive amount of aspartame is less than the trace amounts you get from drinking fruit juice  other claims that anti  aspartame individuals like to push do nt find the need to be grounded in actual scientific fact  for example  there was a study that suggested a link between aspartame and brain cancer  except that the study was flawed and has subsequently been disproven  conspiracy theorists never let the truth get in the way  though  one incorrectly carried out study is all it takes to prove once and for all that something is true  and any later evidence is just a cover up to keep us from seeing the truth  in the end people push this claim because it speaks to their fears of science and the unknown  it feels like big business trying to pump us full of who  knows  what  the fda knows  that s who   to reap profit from our cold  dead  cancer  ridden corpses  i m sure some of this fear is helped along by the producers of sugar who can feel the sting in their pocketbooks as people switch to a zero calorie sweetener  ultimately  though  aspartame is one of the most studied things you will eat all day  and there s been no conclusive evidence that suggests any health disadvantage  except for phenylketonurics  from eating it  even in stupidly large quantities  aspartame is one of the most studied compounds in the world  it s been through trial after trial after trial  and we ve still yet to find any good  solid  concrete evidence that it has any negative health consequences for adult humans at the doses we would normally be ingesting them at  however  due to some studies early in the research of aspartame that suggested it was a carcinogen  it got a bad rap early on  and it s never really shaken it  since it got into the culture so deeply  we do nt find those studies to be particularly credible anymore  but it s hard to overcome the damage it did to the common  knowledge   it is thought to be a carcinogen  causing cancer  tumors  ms  as well as weight gain  diabetes  chronic fatigue  etc  there s no hard evidence to absolutely prove this though  which is why it s still fda approved  and on the market ,0
irancontra was a political scandal that happened in the 1980s during the presidency of ronald reagan it involved the sale of weapons to the government of iran which was against the law and using the money from those sales to help fund a group called the contras who were fighting against the government of nicaragua some of the people involved in the scandal were members of reagans administration the scandal was a big deal at the time and led to several investigations and some people going to prison the implications of the scandal were that it damaged the reputation of the reagan administration and made people question the honesty and integrity of the people involved,1
apple juice is a diuretic which means it can increase the amount of urine your body produces when you drink apple juice your body absorbs the liquid and the excess is filtered out by your kidneys and turned into urine the more you drink the more urine your body produces which can lead to an increase in frequency of urination this is why you may feel the need to urinate more quickly after drinking apple juice compared to other drinks its also worth noting that everyones body is different so the amount of time it takes for you to feel the need to urinate after drinking apple juice may be different from someone elses experience,1
hello i read your query and from what information you have given me it appears that your son has short constitutional stature and not growth hormone deficiency well but it depends on many factors such as the midparental height ethnicity nutritional status etc since he is below the third percentile for age for boys for height i would suggest a proper workup to rule out hormonal deficiencies such as 1 thyroid function test 2 igf1 insluingrowth fractor and igfbp3 insulinlike growth fractor binding protein 3 lh leutinizing hormone and fsh follicle stimulating hormone routine tests like cbc complete blood count esr erythrocyte sedimentation arte 4 liver function test 5 renal function test6 urinalysis and xray of left hand and wrist if the hormone analysis comes out abnormal or in other words there is a deficiency of any of the above hormones and then i would suggest mri pituitary gland because short constitutional stature is not a disorder but a variation in normal growth therefore medical treatment is not usually necessaryso i would not suggest any hormonal treatment as it will not benefit him at this age as his bones have matured by now although some studies do suggest the use of testosterone injections or patches to achieve growth and sexual maturation if necessary growth hormone is not recommended if any of the above tests turn out to be normal as it is associated with a lot of adverse effects i hope my advice is of some benefit to you,0
there are many reasons why different societies may associate sex with shame or view it as a private or taboo topic one reason may be that sex is a very personal and intimate act and some people may feel more comfortable keeping it private another reason may be cultural or religious beliefs that view sex as something that should be reserved for marriage or other specific circumstances additionally some societies may associate sex with negative consequences such as unwanted pregnancies or sexually transmitted infections which could contribute to feelings of shame or discomfort around the topic its also important to note that not all societies view sex as shameful and attitudes towards sex can vary widely depending on cultural and personal beliefs,1

it s hard to do an eli5 for postmodernism  because eli5 is all about reducing a complex thing down into a simple summary  and to the extent that we can say anything meaningful about  postmodernism   it is that postmodernism opposes any attempt to ascribe one broad meaning to any  thing    if you are familiar with postmodernism  this probably made sense to you  if not  then probably not     skip to the bottom for a tldr  i guess  and also for a  postmodern  joke    and if you have zero background in philosophy  you probably wo nt be able to understand postmodernism in the context of the history leading up to it  which of course is kind of  the point  of postmodernism  to the extent that postmodernism  has  a single  point   which of course it does nt  man  i have nt written about postmodernism in a long time  and i ve forgotten how incredibly  meta  and  self  referential  it feels  i m sure that everything that follows will be pure bunk  but here goes  first off  the term   postmodern  originated  i believe  in architecture circles  there was a modern school  style of architecture   postmodern  was used to label the work of architects who came after the modern school and who rejected the assumptions  style  whatever of the modern school  this is nt a particularly important point but it s where my philosophy professor started when i took postmodernism in college  so that s where i ll start  because knowledge should always follow the form of the teacher   ha ha that s another postmodern joke   anyway  there were a bunch of philosophers  descartes comes to mind  but also spinoza and a bunch of others  who went about trying to construct a grand theory of meaning  they were trying to figure out where meaning comes from  from god  from humans  from society  they all had a similar idea  meaning flowed from one single source  much like a light in the center of a web of fiber optic cable  what is  good   what is  evil   what is  real   what is  not real   we can answer all these questions by looking at the center and figuring it out  this is why so many philosophers spent a great deal of time coming up with logical proofs for the existence of god  they figured that god had to be the center  source of all meaning  so they had to show that god existed in order to make sense of reality  along come the existentialists  eli5 version  the existentialists take god out of the center and replace god with the mortal self  in other words  god is nt the source of meaning  it s ourselves  or rather  the source of meaning for me is my self  for you it s your self  this is an extremely unfair simplification of existentialism but it will suit for our purpose  so the existentialists  and the philosophers before them  were all about tracing meaning back to the center  they just disagreed over the center  what was it  was it god or the self  was it something else maybe  what could we know about the source of all meaning  then came the postmodernists  everyone else was constructing these elaborate systems of meaning  with either god or the self at the center as the ultimate source of meaning  and all meaning could be determined in some way through a relationship with the center  the postmodernists chuckled to themselves  and then blew up the center  the postmodernists say  there is no god that gives meaning to everything  and the self does nt give meaning to everything either  come to think of it  say the postmodernists  there is no such thing as  meaning  after all  so stop fucking around trying to find the source of all meaning  what a silly project  the postmodernist approach is that  everything   is   contextual   outside of a specific moment involving specific people  there is no meaning to be found  there are no broad  over  arching truths to be found out about the world  according to the postmodernists  those sorts of broad assertions of fact  truth are meaningless and empty  in fact  the postmodernists go one step further  they say that all those assertions of truth are  inherently unstable   what the hell does that mean  it means that any assertion of  fact  inherently contradicts itself and thus falls apart under analysis  this is a really weird thing to explain to someone who has nt been exposed to postmodernism  so i wo nt bother to explain it further  just know that postmodernists resist attempts to define things because they think the definitions will always be inaccurate and self  defeating   by the way  my entire explanation of postmodernism  up to this point  is an example of something that will contradict itself and fall apart under scrutiny  you want an example of postmodernism in action  just watch subsequent comments which disagree with my explanation  if anybody bothers to write any   the other big thing from postmodernism is the idea that not only is meaning a contingent thing  it is a relation  when someone asserts  the truth  about something  they are saying  the truth  to someone else  in other words  when meaning is asserted  it is asserted in the context of a human relationship  the postmodernists would tell you that all human relationships have a power dynamic  and often the assertion of meaning is a fundamental assertion of power over another person  when you assert meaning  you are trying to get your listener to accept your assertion  which means that you are controlling the meaning of reality  in a sense   by the way  postmodernists do not say that  right  and  wrong  do nt exist  that s a common misconception of postmodernism  instead  what postmodernists say is that judgments of  right  and  wrong  are tied to the very specific circumstances under consideration  including the relationships of all the people involved  the judge  the judged  the witnesses  etc   and  right  and  wrong   in addition to being contingent upon circumstances  are also  negotiated  by all the people involved  it is rarely that one person unilaterally determines what is right versus wrong  rather it is through relationships with others in a physical  living moment  that  right  and  wrong  are determined  indeed  this is how all meaning is determined    tldr    postmodernism   means  that  everything   is   in quotation marks   this will probably only make sense to people who are already familiar with postmodernism  sorry  also  the best postmodern joke was in the onion years ago when derrida died  there was just one line  no article  and it was a throw  away joke but it was brilliant  the headline read  derrida  dies  there are some very good responses in here  and i have to give props to hpcisco7965 for the in depth historical context  just for fun  and in the spirit of eli5  i m going to do my best to reduce the definition as simply and straightforwardly as i can   modernism was a literary  art  and cultural movement that focused heavily on representation and constructed meanings  for instance  modern art expected viewers to draw complex conclusions from that which did not otherwise appear to  mean  anything  literature wanted to create complex meaning between events  characters  symbols  etc  in a way many readers would consider over  analyzing   postmodernism is a rejection of that  at first  it was anything that critiqued  often satirically  this line of thinking  imagine a piece of modern art that is nt  supposed  to mean anything   at postmodernism developed  it became a way to deconstruct  everything   postmodernists went on to assert that nothing has actual meaning other that what we have decided  while on this topic can anyone enlighten me to what realism  modernity  and modernism is referring to in the context of enlish literature ,0
there are a few strategies that individuals and businesses can use to save on taxes by taking losses here are a few examplesbusinesses can offset profits with losses if a business has a profitable year and a loss in another year they can offset the profits with the losses to reduce their overall tax liabilityindividuals can use capital losses to offset capital gains if an individual has realized capital gains from the sale of assets they can use capital losses to offset those gains and reduce their overall tax liabilitybusinesses and individuals can carry losses forward or backward in some cases businesses and individuals can carry losses forward or backward to offset income in future or past tax yearsits important to note that these strategies may be subject to certain limitations and restrictions and its always a good idea to consult with a tax professional to understand how these strategies may apply to your specific situation there are several strategies that individuals and businesses can use to save on taxes by taking losses these strategies can be particularly useful for taxpayers who have experienced a financial setback or have realized losses on investmentsone strategy is to sell investments that have decreased in value known as capital losses to offset capital gains capital gains are profits realized from the sale of capital assets such as stocks real estate or collectibles by selling investments that have decreased in value taxpayers can offset capital gains and reduce their tax liabilityanother strategy is to claim business losses on a tax return if a business incurs more expenses than it generates in revenue it may be able to claim a business loss on its tax return this loss can be used to offset other income such as salary or investment income and reduce the taxpayers overall tax liabilityits important to note that there are limits on the amount of losses that can be claimed and the rules for claiming losses can be complex taxpayers should consult with a tax professional or refer to irs guidance to determine the best strategy for saving on taxes by taking losses,1
no one has demanded such a thing  ie mobile devices with this resolution   since 8k content is more of a novelty   this is the future  thing right now  while 1080p is the mainstream standard  itd be 10   btw  as the screen is measured diagonally and it s  4 times bigger  as in 4 1080p screens arranged in a rectangle  it d be perfectly possible to make a 8 k 10  tablet by that logic was thinking about 4k they d be ludicrously expensive to manufacture  and there s no demand  making a single 20  8k panel would cost far  far more than making sixteen 5  1080p panels  because you d have to make a much larger piece without any defects  edit  did nt know there really is a 8 k resolution  it is around 16x more dense than 1080  but the following still applies  the resolution of a screen is the number of pixels wide by the number of pixels tall  multiply those two numbers together and you get the total number of pixels a screen has  a common number of pixels for a 1080 screen is 2073600  each pixel requires information on what color it is supposed to be  you could have an 8 k display  but you would need a way to encode the information  you can see as the resolution goes up  so does the amount of information needed to display one frame  the amount of memory to do this grows rapidly  so if you had an 8 k screen   4 k x 4 k  that would be something like 16000000 pixels  about 8x more information to store  process and display than your typical 1080  a hard drive would be needed to store that much information  i m not sure the biggest blu  ray disc could handle that much data  this requires a format to be developed for higher resolutions that most of the world can agree on and other things such as hardware to process this new multitude of data  you will also need to worry about the cabling and wires needed to transmit this information from devices to these 8 k screens  there are other concerns such as the time it would take to change all of those pixels to their appropriate color before the next frame is supposed to show  remember  there are at least 16000000 pixels that need a tiny wire running to them  probably 3 or more tiny wires  to turn off and on  that s a lot of switching to handle  tl  dr you probably can make a screen that size at that res  but it s very difficult ,0

you pay a premium on certain frequently used roads  bridges  tunnels in order to supplement the general taxes  this keeps people who use the road more  though not entirely  financially responsible for contributing to upkeep  as opposed to raising taxes on everyone all the time  ly5  every person in your neighborhood has access to dial  up internet because they live there  if people want faster internet  they can pay a  boost fee  for a speed boost  this speed boost makes things faster  but maintenance on the boosters costs a lot of money  the internet company uses the  boost fee  to make the boost lines all better without making everyone in the neighborhoods pay for all the repairs  different roads are funded by different taxes and different governments  some roads are paid for by the cities  others by the states  and some by the federal government  the roads are paid for using various methods  and some states choose to use tolls on the roads as a way for paying for the construction and maintenance  generally  you ll find that there is a way to get to a destination without tolls  unless there s a bridge or tunnel with a toll  in which case you d need to swim to avoid it   you ll see tolls on certain big highways  but not on local roads  so you have a choice as to which you can use  you absolutely can be ticketed for going through a toll plaza without paying it  and the ticket will be for quite a bit more than the toll would have been  this is what s called punitive  an additional penalty designed to discourage you from doing something  if you went through a  3 toll without paying  and once every ten times a police officer caught and ticketed you for  3  you d have no incentive to pay the toll  because your choice is between paying  3  or paying nothing with a small chance to pay  3  rather  the officer will likely ticket you for  50  which far exceeds the cost of the toll  but it makes the option to go through the toll without paying less appealing  the higher penalty you are risking discourages you from attempting it  many toll roads are privatized  and thus are nt paid for by your taxes  not all  but some ,0
it is not currently possible to fertilize a womans egg with the set of chromosomes from another ovum egg cell this is because the process of fertilization requires the combination of a womans egg and a mans sperm which contain half of the chromosomes needed to create a babynnevery person has 46 chromosomes in each of their cells which are arranged in 23 pairs one chromosome in each pair is inherited from the persons mother and the other is inherited from the persons father when a womans egg is fertilized by a mans sperm the resulting embryo receives 23 chromosomes from the egg and 23 chromosomes from the sperm giving it a complete set of 46 chromosomesnnwhile it is theoretically possible to combine the chromosomes from two eggs to create an embryo this is not something that can be done in practice because the process of fertilization requires the egg to be fertilized by a sperm additionally even if it were possible to combine the chromosomes from two eggs it is not clear whether the resulting embryo would be viable or healthy therefore it is not a technique that is currently being pursued in reproductive medicine,1
it is not accurate to say that child prodigies or exceptionally gifted children are more likely to have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd than other children adhd is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects about 5 of children and is characterized by inattention impulsivity and hyperactivity it is not related to a persons level of intelligence or talent child prodigies are children who have exceptional abilities or talents in a particular area such as music math or science these abilities may be the result of a combination of genetic and environmental factors including a natural aptitude or interest in the subject early exposure to and practice in the area and supportive parents or teachers it is possible that some child prodigies may also have adhd but this is not necessarily the case it is important to remember that adhd and exceptional abilities are separate and unrelated things,1

airplanes for all their crashes  are actually among the safest forms of transportation  this is because the people who actually control the majority of the airplanes safety decisions  the pilots  are on board the craft  and if the craft fails  they die  by contrast  boats are among the most accident prone means of transportation  this is because  despite ideas like the captain going down with the ship  the kinds of accidents that ships encounter do nt usually threaten the captain  and even when they do  the people who make the more important safety decisions for ships are the owners  who say whether you go through the storm or not  and whether you get a new engine or not  who may risk some money  but not their lives  too  big  to  fail  tbtf  banks are like ships  tbtf means that they are so important to the functioning of society that society will bail them out if there is a problem  even if they caused it  this reduces or eliminates any incentive for the tbtf bank to be cautious  since they know that  even if something bad happens  they will be saved  so it s heads they win  tails everyone else loses  even if it would be cheaper for the tbtf entity to just play it safer  sometimes bailouts may be good policy and necessary  but the idea is to make banks more like planes  and less like ships  removing the notion of  failing  means that the bank has a lot less incentive to use discretion and caution  if they know the government will just bail them out when things get bad  then they can take greater risks with other people s money  this is a super complex issue  which is probably why you asked it on r  eli5   and may be too complex of an explanation for eli5  but here goes  the best way to understand it is to look at the consequences of either avenue you choose to take  note  these are the extreme circumstances  irl these would probably be tempered by the complexity of financial markets  govt intervention  etc   etc   1  let tbtf banks fail  domino effect ensues per u  historytech s comment  or something similar to it  there s a huge loss in  liquidity   meaning money ca nt get to where it needs to be fast enough   people ca nt get loans for mortgages  companies ca nt borrow money to float through seasonal or yearly changes  economy tanks  water shortage  civil war  dictators  just kidding about the last three p   on the upside  the surviving banks will make sure to never play it  fast and loose  again  but that also decreases the amount of money they loan out and therefore makes it more expensive to get loans  which only adds to the current problem  in the short term  things would get great depression bad in large scale economic terms  in the long term  think  decades   not years  new banks would see how much money you can make and enter the market  increasing money being lent  decreasing the cost of borrowing and everything would return to normal  and probably be more stable than before since banks would be more cautious  2  save tbtf banks  avoid domino effect and some short term harm to the economy  economy dips  but the bottom is theoretically much better than the alternative  in the long term  banks have less  and some  much less  of an incentive to protect their assets  read  other people s cash  against their own risky investing  and since greater risk  greater reward  they go after more risky investments   potentially  this could lead to much more risky behavior by banks and another crash  bailout cycle  it also leads to more financial institutions trying to raise themselves to tbtf status so they can be protected by the government from themselves  this leads to less competition and much less stability within financial markets ,0

in the foreign exchange forex market a lot is a standard unit of measure for a trade the size of a lot can vary depending on the broker and the type of account that you havea standard lot is typically 100000 units of the base currency in a forex trade for example if you are trading eurusd a standard lot would be 100000 eur if you are trading a mini lot the size of the trade would be 10000 units of the base currency and if you are trading a micro lot the size of the trade would be 1000 units of the base currencyits important to note that the value of a lot will vary depending on the exchange rate between the two currencies being traded for example if the exchange rate for eurusd is 120 a standard lot of 100000 eur would be worth 120000 usd in the foreign exchange market a lot is a standard unit of measurement for currency trades one lot is equal to 100000 units of the base currency in a currency pair so in the case of the eurusd currency pair one lot would be equal to 100000 eurosthere are also smaller units of measurement known as mini lots and micro lots which are equal to 10000 and 1000 units of the base currency respectivelythe value of a lot can vary depending on the leverage being used and the current exchange rate of the currency pair for example if you are trading eurusd with a leverage of 1100 and the exchange rate is 120 one lot would be worth approximately 120000 100000 x 120 x 100its important to note that trading in the foreign exchange market carries significant risks and it is not suitable for everyone it is important to thoroughly understand the risks and to have a solid understanding of the market before making any trades,1

because wilson v arkansas did nt make a blanket announcement that police must knock and announce every time  there are still practical exceptions which is why scotus said that it would be a case  by  case review  exceptions include reasonable threat of danger and reasonable belief evidence would be destroyed  it makes no sense to require knock and announce in a hostage situation  not having the element of surprise could get the hostage and others killed  typically they do nt want to knock and announce for drug busts because it can lead to evidence being destroyed  the most simple answer to this question is  the supreme court of the united states said so   the more complicated answer is that while a knock and announce is part of the common law  this requirement can be done away with when there s good reason to  those reasons generally fall under the category of safety  preventing the destruction of evidence  and preventing escape  though this goes back to  the supreme court said so   it can  of course  be done away with by statute  but the answer to that is that the various legislatures have not seen fit to pass a law to make it illegal  so it dosnt brake the 4th amendment cause there is a warrant issued by a judge the main difference is the person or place in question is deemed dangerous or that the item they are looking for might be destroyed if they knocked  not sure abot the court ruling  but for the 4th amendment there is a warrant so it not a search with out a warrant,0

thats an interesting question evolution doesnt really work by animals trying to become better or worse in the way that we might think of it instead it works through a process called natural selection where animals that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and have babies those babies will then inherit the traits that helped their parents survive and over time those traits can become more common in the populationrnrnso its possible that some animals evolved to be less scary because it gave them some kind of advantage for example maybe they were able to sneak up on their prey more easily or maybe they were able to find mates more easily because they were less intimidating on the other hand its also possible that some animals just didnt need to be as scary because they already had other ways of defending themselves or finding foodrnrnas for sharks its true that some species of sharks like the megalodon were much larger and more intimidating than the sharks we see today however its also possible that the smaller less scary sharks of today are actually better adapted to their environment than the megalodon was we cant know for sure without more information,1
a graphical model is a probabilistic model for representing the relationships between variables in a graph each variable is represented as a node in the graph and the edges between the nodes represent the relationships between the variables the graph encodes a set of conditional independencies between the variables which means that the probability distribution of the variables can be represented compactly by only specifying the values of the variables that are directly connected by edges in the graphnnnngraphical models are used to represent and reason about complex systems in which the relationships between the variables are uncertain or hard to quantify they are a useful tool for modeling and analyzing data particularly in the fields of machine learning statistical modeling and artificial intelligencennnnthere are two main types of graphical models directed graphical models also known as bayesian networks and undirected graphical models also known as markov random fields in a directed graphical model the edges in the graph represent a causal relationship between the variables while in an undirected graphical model the edges represent a statistical relationship between the variablesnnnngraphical models provide a powerful framework for representing and reasoning about complex systems and have been applied to a wide range of problems including speech recognition image classification natural language processing and many others,1
if a plane is flying and caught fire the wind would not have much of an effect on the fire the fire would be fueled by the planes own fuel and other materials on board and the wind would not be strong enough to significantly change the size or intensity of the firernrnthe fire on a plane could potentially be extinguished by the crew using fire extinguishers or other equipment on board however if the fire is too large or too difficult to control the pilots may need to make an emergency landing to try and get the plane and passengers to safety,1
inbreeding is the mating of closely related individuals such as siblings or cousins when two individuals who are related mate they are more likely to pass on similar traits to their offspring because they share many of the same genes this can lead to the expression of genetic disorders or physical abnormalities that would not normally appear in a population with more diverse genetic makeuprnrnone reason for this is that inbreeding can lead to the expression of recessive genes recessive genes are genes that are not expressed in an individual unless they have two copies of the gene one from each parent if an individual has only one copy of the recessive gene it is masked by the dominant gene and does not show up in the individuals physical appearance however if an individual mates with another individual who also has a copy of the same recessive gene their offspring has a higher chance of inheriting two copies of the gene and expressing the trait associated with that genernrninbreeding can also lead to a decrease in genetic diversity which can make a population more susceptible to diseases and environmental challenges it is important to maintain genetic diversity in a population to ensure its longterm health and survival,1
these explanations are all brutal if you re supposed to be actually explaining dx to laymen  i will put everything in point form because i m a software engineer and do nt believe in wasting my time with stupid crap like grammar  haha   directx is a piece of software  called an api  developed by microsoft for their windows operating system  it allows programs on your computer  such as video games  cad software  etc to access your computer s hardware  such as graphics  sound  keyboard and mouse  in a very lightweight manner  very importantly  it allows hardware independence  this means that the same video game will work on every computer without having to be rewritten for every single machine it s expected to run on  it is actually composed of a couple of components  direct3d  directshow  directsound  directinput  and a few more i m probably missing   by far  the most important of these  and the one ms has sunk the most time and money into  is direct3d  as you may know  everything you see in a 3d video game is made of a bunch of polygons  even if you see a sphere  it s actually made of a bunch of tiny triangles that are so small that they give the illusion of a smooth curve   here is an example of leon from resident evil 4 to help you visualize this fact  url0  direct3d allows video games to say to the 3d graphics hardware   hey man  here are a bunch of triangles and here are instructions on where to put them  what color they should be  what textures they should have  how to light them up  etc   directsound allows video games to say to the sound card   hey dude  here is a sound wave i want to you play through the speakers at this volume  with this speed  and i want you to mix it with several other sounds   a version of directx has shipped with windows ever since windows 95  but they were horrible   windows xp shipped with directx 9  which was considered to be the first version of dx that did nt totally suck   ever since then  directx 10 came with vista and directx 11 with windows 7   video games are generally tested with very specific subversions of directx  ex  directx version 1022345  since they do nt want to take a risk with a version they were nt tested on  they almost always install directx on your computer whether they need it or not   luckily  microsoft was smart enough to come up with a versioning system that makes it so they do nt all step on each other s feet  directx is a set of programming libraries which interact with the drivers for the hardware on your computer  the idea is that when writing an application  a developer can use directx algorithms instead of having to reinvent them to save time and effort  directx is a collection of multimedia apis for programmers  mostly for gaming but also a  v players and editors  they abstract the really grimy details of how to interact with the hardware on a system so a developer does nt need to add code to their programs to deal with different ways of accomplishing something or different capabilities of various pieces of hardware like video or sound cards  you need directx installed because when a developer uses directx in their program  their program just contains a reference to code in the directx library and not the actual code  so you just install it once on your system and then everything that needs it knows where to find it ,0
american psycho is a dark comedy film about a wealthy young wall street investment banker named patrick bateman who is secretly a serial killer the film is based on a novel of the same name by bret easton ellis the appeal of the film is that it is a satirical commentary on the excesses and superficiality of 1980s culture particularly the materialism and greed of the wall street world it is supposed to be a serious film but it is also meant to be humorous in its portrayal of batemans psychosis and the absurdity of his actions some viewers may find the films violence and dark humor disturbing while others may find it amusing,1
there is an explosion like any grenade  but the shell is much stronger so no shrapnel is blasted out  that accounts for the loud noise  the flashing lighting is almost definitely magnesium  which is known for giving off bright light when lit   the combination of light and sound just temporarily disorients you body without serious harm  your average stun grenade contains no shrapnel so it s just like standing next to a big firecracker when it goes off  the concussion of the explosion is what  stuns  you  not guaranteed to work 100  of the time  then there are flash bangs  again no shrapnel or hurty bits  it just generates a really loud bang and flash when it goes off  dazing whoever is unfortunate to stand too close  they are made with aluminum and potassium perchlorate  the potassium perchlorate is an oxidizer  which is mainly responsible for the materials exploding  aluminum gives off a bunch of light when it burns  causing the flash  sometimes magnesium is also used   the casing of the grenade has holes in it to allow the materials to blow out without exploding the casing and creating shrapnel  the light emitted is too strong for your eyes to handle  momentarily blinding the victim  this is because the photoreceptors in your eyes are overstimulated by the massive amount of light  and they take time to return to their normal state  the noise is loud enough to disturb fluids in the ear  causing difficulty hearing and balance loss  while the lack of shrapnel and lower explosive power than a standard grenade makes them safer  they still emite a strong enough concussive wave to cause injury  as well as the immensely hot burning materials  there are a few cases of permanent disfigurement and death caused by flashbang use ,0
the koch brothers are two american businessmen who are known for their political activities and for supporting conservative causes they are the owners of koch industries one of the largest privatelyheld companies in the united states which includes businesses in a variety of industries such as energy chemicals and consumer productsrnrnthe koch brothers have been involved in politics for many years and they have used their wealth and influence to support candidates and causes that align with their political views they have done this in a number of ways including by making large donations to political campaigns by supporting organizations that promote their political views and by funding research and advocacy efforts on issues that are important to themrnrnone reason the koch brothers have been able to have such a large influence in politics is because they are very wealthy and they have used their wealth to support causes and candidates that align with their views they have also been very effective at staying out of the spotlight which has helped them avoid negative publicity and scrutiny in addition they have been able to build a large network of likeminded individuals and organizations that work together to promote their political agendarnrnoverall the koch brothers have been able to exert a significant influence on politics in the united states by using their wealth their connections and their ability to stay out of the spotlight to support candidates and causes that align with their views,1
vagrancy is generally not considered a crime in and of itself but rather a status that may be associated with certain behaviors that are criminalized for example someone who is homeless and has no means of support might be charged with vagrancy if they engage in activities like panhandling or loitering in public places poverty and unemployment are not illegal it is not a crime to be poor or to be unemployed however some people who are poor or unemployed may engage in illegal activities in order to survive or make ends meet such as stealing or selling drugs in these cases it is the illegal activity that is being punished not the poverty or unemployment itself it is important to remember that the laws of a society are designed to protect the wellbeing and safety of all members of the community some behaviors such as those that harm others or disrupt public order are considered illegal in order to maintain a safe and orderly society however it is not the intention of the law to punish people for being poor or unemployed,1
a hedge is a financial instrument that is used to reduce the risk of investment by providing a means to offset potential losses there are several different types of hedges that can be used including options futures and short selling these hedges work by allowing an investor to limit the potential loss on an investment while still allowing the possibility of profitoptions are contracts that give the holder the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a security at a predetermined price on or before a certain date an investor who owns a stock can use options to hedge against potential declines in the price of the stock for example the investor could purchase a put option which gives them the right to sell the stock at a certain price if the price of the stock falls below the predetermined price the investor can exercise the put option and sell the stock at the higher price limiting their lossfutures are contracts that obligate the buyer to purchase a security or commodity at a predetermined price on a specific date in the future an investor can use futures to hedge against potential price movements in a particular security or commodity for example if an investor expects the price of oil to rise they can purchase a futures contract to lock in a lower price for oil in the future if the price of oil does indeed rise the investor can sell the oil at the higher price offsetting their loss on the futures contractshort selling is a way to hedge against potential price increases in a security when an investor short sells a security they borrow the security from someone else and sell it hoping to buy it back later at a lower price if the price of the security does indeed fall the investor can buy it back at the lower price and return it to the original owner realizing a profit however if the price of the security rises the investor will incur a losshedges can be an effective way to manage risk but they also involve some level of complexity and carry their own set of risks it is important for investors to understand how hedges work and the risks involved before using them,1

sure f stands for force m stands for mass and a stands for acceleration this equation is a way to understand how force and mass are related to acceleration its called newtons second law of motionrnrnheres how it works lets say you want to push a box across the floor if the box is really heavy has a lot of mass it will be hard to get it moving on the other hand if the box is lighter has less mass it will be easier to pushrnrnthe equation fma helps us understand this relationship between force mass and acceleration it tells us that the force needed to move an object f is equal to the mass of the object m multiplied by its acceleration arnrnso if you want to push a heavy box across the floor you will need to use a lot of force to get it moving but if you want to push a lighter box you wont need to use as much forcernrni hope that helps explain it a little bit do you have any other questions about this equation,1

there are a few reasons why it might be cheaper to buy a flight ticket from a travel agent rather than directly from the airline none reason is that travel agents often have access to discounted rates that are not available to the general public these discounts can come from various sources such as bulk purchasing agreements with airlines or partnerships with hotels and other travel providers by buying through a travel agent you may be able to take advantage of these discounts and get a lower price on your flight nanother reason is that travel agents may be able to bundle your flight with other travel services such as a hotel room or car rental which can result in a lower overall price this can be especially useful if you are planning a multidestination trip or need to make multiple bookings for a group of people nfinally travel agents may also be able to offer additional services and support such as helping you choose the best flight options or assisting with rebooking or cancellations these added services can be worth the additional cost for some travelers even if it means paying a slightly higher price for the flight ticket noverall its worth considering both options â€“ buying directly from the airline and buying through a travel agent â€“ and comparing the prices and services offered to find the best deal for your specific travel needs,1
you are correct in that theoretically any planet could have some weird lifeform that we ca nt even imagine  living in extreme conditions  now you have to understand  that if we actually manage to find life on another planet  that is a pretty big deal  among other things  it could give us valuable insights in how life is formed  so we definitely want to find alien life  sooner rather than later  however  we do nt have the time  the resources or the technology to thoroughly inspect every single planet and moon  there s just too many of them  especially if we do nt even know if they can contain life at all  as i said  they very well might be able to contain an alien life form  but we can not imagine what kind of lifeform that would be  so it s more efficient and probably more fruitful if we focus on the lifeforms we dã³ understand  lifeforms similar to those on earth  that is why we focus our research on planets and moons with earth  like conditions  tldr it s more efficient to look for lifeforms that we know exist  and that we understand  earth  like life forms  it would answer one of the biggest questions around since we started looking to the stars   are we alone   of course it would nt mean we have found a planet to migrate to but it would mean that we could learn a lot about the origin of life  also a lot of religions would be placed in a position of having to find explanations for this    tldr   our society and understanding of the universe would change significantly in almost all aspects  yes  but we have no idea what totally alien life looks like  we ve narrowed down our search to candidates which can support life we can recognize  ie planets where organisms from earth might be able to survive ,0

your intuition is correct  and that is exactly how cartridge selection for the military has progressed over the years  the standard issue rifle for us troops  the m16  m4 fires the 556 nato cartridge  which has a very small  015 ounce  bullet traveling at blistering speeds  2000 mph   compare that to the previous us military infantry rifle catridges that had bullets that weighed 3 times as much like the 30  06 in the m1 garand  there are other factors that went into selecting a catridge with a lighter  faster bullet  accuracy during full auto  amount of ammo a soldier can carry  politics  et cetera  but militaries around the world tend to favor light  very fast bullets for infantry rifles  there are lot more factors than just the muzzle energy  momentum plays a big role  p  m  v  there is the rate at which energy is transferred from the bullet to the target  transfer energy too quickly and the bullet wo nt penetrate far enough to do much damage  transfer it too slowly and the bullet will just keep going through the target  then a wall  then another wall  then your buddy covering the back door   there is the rate at which the bullet loses velocity as it travels  a bullet may be carrying a tremendous amount of energy as it leaves the barrel at 4000 feet per second  but that s not very useful if it s only moving 1000 feet per second when it reaches your target 100 yards away   this is nt just momentum  there are a lot of factors that deal with the bullet s shape that affect this as well    there is the impact of environmental factors  a 10 mph crosswind might push a light bullet 2 or 3 inches off target in 100 yards but only move a heavy bullet half an inch  tree branches can completely deflect a light bullet moving very fast but not impact a large  slow bullet at all  then there are other factors   weight is a  huge  impact  the 556 fired from an m16 has a muzzle velocity of roughly 3110fps  1764 joules of energy  and a 20 round magazine weighs 300 grams  it replaced the 762 cartridge which  when fired from an m14 has a muzzle velocity of about 2800 fps  about 3463 joules of energy and a 20 round magazine weigh 680 grams   the bigger bullet hits almost twice as hard  but weighs more than than twice as much per round fired    faster is not necessarily more accurate  long bullets moving at a  reasonable  speed with their weight distributed as close to a cylinder as possible are most accurate   the faster a bullet is moving  the harder it is to stabilize  it needs to spin faster  but there are limitations on how fast you can twist a bullet in a barrel with rifling before it simply shears across the lands and does nt really spin at all   for better or worse  however  the military wants accuracy first and foremost  there are  other options   url0  that provide more effective stopping power due to the way that the bullet behaves  after  it hits the target  but are less accurate as a result  that have nt gained traction  for example  getting the 556 mm cartridge faced similar problems initially because it was nt accurate out to 500 or a thousand yards like the 762 mm or 30  06 cartridges previously used could  end result  it s complicated  for both physics and and political reasons  external and terminal ballistics are a pretty established science  it s tough to beat them  first  momentum is important too  and small fast bullets with the same energy have significantly less momentum  also  small  fast bullets are harder on gun barrels than slower  heavier bullets  so barrel life can be a factor on the decision  within a single caliber  smaller  faster bullets  which has to mean means shorter since the circle is by definition the same  lose more of their energy in flight than longer  heavier  slower bullets   in many defensive scenarios to much energy and too much momentum  and over penetration  is just as important a consideration as too little energy  and under penetration   there s an important balance point required  there are products out there that tend toward smaller faster bullets  the 57x28 in pistols is a famous  divisive example   or the popular 223556x45 is a popular small  fast bullet in rifles  and there are   lots   of wildcat rifle rounds that push toward that end of energy curves  ,0

nits not necessarily true that most car accident footage is from russia there are many countries where it is common for people to have dashcams installed in their vehicles and accidents are often captured on these cameras its possible that you have seen more footage from russia because the country has a high number of dashcam users or because footage from russia is more likely to be shared onlinennits also important to note that having a dashcam does not necessarily mean that someone is drunk while driving dashcams can be useful for a variety of reasons such as recording accidents or incidents on the road for insurance purposes or for capturing driving experiences for personal use some people use dashcams for safety purposes to help protect themselves in case of an accident or other incident on the roadnnits not accurate to say that all people in russia are drunk while driving either while it is true that drunk driving is a serious problem in many countries including russia it is not true that all people in russia engage in this behavior like in any country there are responsible and irresponsible drivers in russia,1
they built the electronics to survive the conditions by using materials that do nt degrade   much  anyway  gold is a good one  that s why the voyager record is plated in gold  it s expected to last approximately a billion years before it becomes unreadable  actually  the cold is less of a problem than you d think  most spacecraft have more trouble getting rid of excess heat than with freezing  that s because without air to conduct heat away  you have to rely on radiation which is a much slower process  spacecraft will often have large radiators to deal with the heat problem  the bigger problems are debris and radiation  those are dealt with by various forms of shielding  either strong materials to protect from debris or conductive materials to protect from radiation  aluminum is nice  because it fits both requirements  is lightweight so it s cheaper to launch  and is relatively common and easy to work with  on spacecraft like that  the electronics are kept in a  warm electronics box   there is a radioactive isotope inside the box that generates heat  it keeps the electronics from freezing  as well as providing electrical power for them  they know how much energy the isotope gives off  and how much gets consumed by the electronics  and then given off as heat waste  so it s all a matter of balancing things so that the energy bled off into space by the radiators matches the energy generated by the power systems  and keeping that energy balance  flow in the range that the spacecraft s electronics find comfortable  a log of design work goes into spacecraft  despite what they sometimes look like  they re not just a bunch of parts bolted together wherever there was room  i ll take the cold case  it s warm inside the body of the spacecraft due to all the electronics  which are powered by rtgs  radioisotope thermoelectric generators   in areas that are not warm  like on the science boom  there are heaters  without the heaters or ambient heat from other electronics some of the electronics would freeze  as voyager runs out of power  as the rtgs nuclear fuel decays  heaters will eventually need to be switched off and it is unclear whether the scientific instruments will continue to operate ,0

ok  so  the bureau of land management is a government agency that owns a lot of land out in the west  in nevada especially  where the blm literally owns most of the land in the state  ranchers use blm land to graze cattle  it s a good deal  the ranchers do nt have to purchase lots of land  and the government gets grazing fees from the ranchers  there s a rancher out in nevada who grazed on blm land  there was some dispute 20 years ago  regarding the habitat of an endangered tortoise that lived where he was grazing  back about 15 years ago  the blm revoked his grazing permit  but  he continues to graze his cattle on blm land without a permit  eventually  the government got fed up with it  went to court  and got an order to impound the cattle that had been illegally grazing on federal property  the rancher has made claims that this is really his land  his birthright  from before the blm owned the land  so  before the 1870s   he does nt seem to have any legal claim that a court will recognize  he has a lot of support  mostly from other ranchers who do nt like the idea that a tortoise habitat can take precedence over their livelihoods  so  there s protests and the like  but the basic issue is this  he s already had his day in court  he s already lost  and he does nt like the result  his ranch does not extend into the the federal land  i am at a loss as to why people think it s ok for an individual to use up public resources to make a profit  he can still graze his cows on his private ranch  no one is removing cattle off his private property they are removing them off public property  the reality is the western states do not have sufficient grazing for the number of cattle they want to raise  to add a bit more complexity to this  it was reagan who  by executive order  imposed grazing fees for cattle on public lands  seems to present a bit of a conundrum for the reagan conservatives   executive order 12548 grazing fees  february 14  1986   url0 ,0
eating three times a day is a habit that has developed over time and is not necessarily based on how long a person can go without eating the human body needs a constant supply of nutrients to function properly and eating small meals throughout the day can help provide the body with the energy and nutrients it needs eating three times a day also helps to regulate blood sugar levels and can prevent overeating or eating too much at once which can lead to weight gain in addition eating regular meals can help improve overall health and prevent certain medical conditions such as high blood pressure diabetes and heart disease its important to remember that everyones nutritional needs are different and the amount and frequency of meals that are right for one person may not be the same for another its important to talk to a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian to determine the right meal plan for your individual needs,1
that s kind of how it works but there are a few distinct things to point out  see diagrams on this page  url0 essentially your cars engine is an air pump  fuel is ignited and hot gasses are created  these expand rapidly and force pistons to move  in a turbo charged vehicle  the exhaust gasses generated in combustion are used to drive a turbine that has a compressor attached to the front of it  that in turn compresses some of the air being taken in by the engine and forces it into the cylinder with the rest of the air that was headed there  more air in the cylinder is good for a few reasons  one because your car is an air pump and more air inside the cylinder allows for more fuel to be added and ignited which in turns generates more hot and rapidly expanding gas which again increases cylinder pressure  why could nt we just add more fuel then you might ask  because we ca nt ignite fuel in a car without the presence of air  too much fuel and the ratio falls out of balance and less power  hot expanding gasses as the fuel does nt burn properly   same goes for too much air  why do nt we just make the turbo push in more air  because too much compressed air from the turbo  which is quite hot and is the reason intercoolers exist  could prematurely ignite the fuel mixture before it should  which runs the risk of causing engine damage  and also upsets the balance that an engine prefers to produce maximum power  produce the greatest amount and best temperature of hot gasses to push the pistons  so  if you follow all that  engines are essentially an air pump  turbo s compress air and force it into the cylinder which allows for more fuel to be burned which in turn results in more hot gasses being created  this increases the pressure in the cylinder which in turn forces the piston down  fire is created when you mix oxygen and a fuel source in the presence of heat  it generally results in gasses that expand  air is a pretty good source of oxygen  gasoline is a good fuel  burns really well  the engine of a car creates power by combining gasoline and air then burning them  the expanding gasses are used to drive engine cylinders  when you press down your gas pedal  you get more gasoline in the cylinder  creating more powerful explosions  this works up to the point where you have as much gas as your air can make burn  past that point  adding more gas does nothing but waste gas  a turbocharger uses a turbine to force more air into the cylinder  allowing you to burn more gas than you could with a normal engine that just  sucks air in   more air  more gas  bigger explosions  more power  a supercharger does the same thing but powers the fan differently  a turbocharger uses the leftover gases coming out of the engine to drive the fan while a supercharger uses the  spinning power  coming out of the engine to drive the fan  simply put  it forces more air into the engine which makes it work more efficiently  since combustion engines work essentially by creating explosions in a small space  the more air you can force in there the higher the pressure and the greater the energy output ,0

so  you have to start by remembering that all sound is just a vibration  musical instruments get their sound by having a vibrating piece  like a reed  or a string  or the musician s lips  and then funnel that vibration through the instrument to refine the sound  the way the instrument sounds is caused by the fact that this process produces not just one vibration  but a complex set of them  your ears sort of collapse all of what are called the overtones into just one note  but the different overtones cause you to perceive the different sounds of each instrument  even when they re playing the same note  so  thought some scientists  what if we made our own instruments from the ground up  and they came up with the synthesizer  the synthesizer produces sounds by creating vibrations that are tailored by the person making the music  the first ones used basic sounds that you may recognize from early video game music or chiptunes   sine wave follows the same pattern as the graph of y  sinx   the vibration s waveform  the shape of the sound wave  looks like  this   url3  and the note sounds like  this   url1   square wave similar in shape to the sine wave  but instead of rising and falling smoothly  it jumps almost instantly between the maximum  minimum  and zero values  the waveform and sound are both available in  this video   url2    triangle wave this one goes up and down at a rate that forms a straight line  you can see and hear this wave  here   url0    sawtooth wave this one runs smoothly up to the maximum value  then drops immediately to the minimum and repeats  you can see and hear this wave  here   url4   now  if you paid close attention to those last videos  you ll notice the wave changed as he changed the pitch  the shorter the wavelength  the distance between peaks of the wave   the higher the pitch sounded  the longer it was  the lower the pitch  similarly  the amplitude  how high the maximum and how low the minimum are  controls volume larger amplitude means louder sound  now  once these building blocks were in place  more tools followed  the synths i showed above will produce music  but it s kind of robotic  this is because instruments produce sound that change their waveforms over time  so  one of the basic ways to mimic this is the asdr sound envelope  this stands for the following   attack how does the sound behave when the note begins  does it strike hard  does it fade in gently   decay what happens after the attack  does it hold steady  does it drop down so the attack is louder than the note   sustain how does the sound behave while the sound is held  does it get louder  does the pitch wobble to create vibrato  does the volume change frequently to make a pulsing sound   release how does the sound behave when it ends  is it a clipped ending  a gradual fade  so now you cans tart with a number of waveforms which have different sounds  and you can modify them to get different  sounding notes  from there it s just a matter of adding more and more tools that allow the artist to edit the waveform of the synthesizer without having to manually go in and mess with the curve of the waveform  although some people do that  too   once you have the synthesizer sounding the way you want it  the rest is just like composing any other music  special note on drum sounds  there are two types of drum sounds you often find in electronic music  one of them is just a low  rounded note  much like the sound of the timpani or the bass drum  the other is based on noise  the static from a tv is  white noise   one type of the noise we re talking about here   the reason noise works as a basis for s drum sound is that drums do nt have nice  clean harmonics the different vibrations they produce do nt stack up neatly the way other instruments  do  instead  they produce a chaotic assortment of vibrations that our hearing ca nt resolve into one note  giving them the characteristic  bang  sound  noise works well as a starting point for things like a snare drum effect because it  too  is a chaotic mixture of vibrations  there are many tools that can be used to refine the noise into the particular sound desired  as with other synths  in addition to this  of course  you can also use  samples  which is just a term meaning you can include other recording  spoken words  bits of another song  vocal snippets  and arrange them to play in a rhythm just lie arranging notes in any other piece of music  you can also create samples synths  where a  real  instrument is recorded and then that sound is pitch  shifted andor set to a rhythm instead of building the sound from scratch  a lot is from digital instruments  whether those are midi instruments  you play and then the data goes to a computer where the notes are reproduced with software  or programs that can recreate certain instruments digitally  there are also massive databases  gigabytes and gigabytes  of sounds  melodies  rhythms  etc  some you can download for free  but usually higher quality ones cost money  all of these are compiled in daws  digital audio workstations   like ableton  sonar  bitwig  cubase  fruity loops  etc  this is super simplified but if you have any more questions i d be happy to answer them  synthesizer fan here  to make a musical tone digitally they use math to do the same thing that the filters  envelope generator and other parts of an analog synthesizer do  let s look at a very basic synthesis  you start with a wave form  typically a sawtooth  square or triangle wave  sometimes a sine wave  this is the basis of the note and the sound  the wave you choose affects the sound more than anything else  sine is crisp and clear  square is harsh and piercing  most old  school computer speakers used square  for instance  saw and triangle are somewhere in the middle  crisper than a square but still some  buzz  in them  then come the filters  you put it through filters that alter the sound  and shape it as well  the most powerful is the envelope generator  this part determines how fast the sound goes from no sound to full volume  attack   how long it holds at that volume  sustain  and the rate and length of the  trailing off  of the note  decay and release   a large part of the sound of an instrument is these factors  a piano  for example  has very short attack  tons of sustain and a long release  a snare drum has very short attack  short sustain  short release for a very short note  a synth can make sounds that natural instruments can not though  take a  pad  type background noise  it has very very long attack so it slowly swells to peak volume  no real instruments can do that  other filters might take parts out of the waveform  or duplicate parts  or  fuzz  them away from the pure ideal wave form  in analog synths and their digital versions the most common dial is resonance which fuzzes out the wave form so it has harmonics in it  think that big  really fat 70s moog sound in a song like heart s magic man  the breakdown in the middle  when the synth tone gets fuzzier and fuzzier as they play louder and louder right before the vocals kick back in  that is someone upping the resonance  some synth sounds will then run it through effects filters  which apply mathematical transformations  guitar pedals offer many of the same options as the modules in a synth  chorus takes the sound  and duplicates it in another octave  echo delays it and reduces the volume then mixes it in  flange plays it back with a pitch shift and delay and mixes it over the original sound  phaser shifts it in time and layers it  this is enough to make a really powerful and versatile synthesizer  but it s not enough  see that is just one oscillator making one tone  modern digital synths can use dozens of oscillators  for example  i can take a really heavy saw  wave bass and alter it s volume based on the output of a second oscillator set to a sine wave  this gives a vibrato effect  set the frequency of the second oscillator low enough and make the effect very pronounced and you go from vibrato to apocalyptic dubstep wub  wub  wub sound  the  wub  being the increase and decrease in volume as the volume follows the second oscillator sine wave  to get a very complex sound like the classic 70s  star drops   think the opening to  dream weaver   you might need four or five oscillators interacting  my softsynth i use offers me up to 64 oscillators at once  studio  grade software can offer up to four times that  now this is all part of the package  you can also use other methods like sample synthesis  you take a wav file of a piano note and you play it back pitch shifted  and large sample banks  many songs use both approaches  with modelling synths used in addition to sample patches ,0

default logic is a form of nonmonotonic logic that is used to reason about uncertain or incomplete information in default logic a default assumption is a statement that is assumed to be true unless there is evidence to the contrary these default assumptions are used to fill in missing information and make inferences in situations where the available information is incomplete or uncertainnnnnone of the key features of default logic is that it allows for the introduction of new information that may override or negate a default assumption this means that default logic can be used to revise and update beliefs as new information becomes available making it a useful tool for reasoning about the uncertain and changing worldnnnndefault logic is often used in artificial intelligence and knowledge representation systems to help reason about and make inferences from uncertain or incomplete data it has also been applied in other fields such as linguistics philosophy and psychology as a way to model how people make inferences and decisions in the face of uncertainty,1

kobe beef is a type of beef that comes from a specific breed of cow called tajimagyu which is native to the hyogo prefecture in japan these cows are raised using very specific methods including being fed a special diet and being massaged and given beer to drink the combination of these factors results in the production of meat that is particularly tender flavorful and wellmarbled which means that it has a high level of fat that is evenly distributed throughout the muscle tissuewhile it is possible for cows of other breeds to be raised using similar methods the tajimagyu breed is considered to produce the best quality kobe beef this is because the breed has been selectively bred over many generations to produce meat with specific characteristics and the conditions in which the cows are raised in japan are also thought to be ideal for producing highquality beefin addition to the breed and methods of production the kobe beef industry is also strictly regulated in japan which helps to ensure that only beef that meets certain standards is sold as kobe beef this is not the case in other countries where the term kobe beef may be used to describe beef that does not meet the same standards as authentic kobe beef from japan,1

it deals with how that particular injury heals  your skin is multilayered  the very top layers are actually dead  underneath are the living tissues  softer   normal skin  layers closer to the surface and  basal  layers below  these basal layers are slightly different from the ones closer to the surface and when you are injured  they play a role in  filling the gap   in small  superficial wounds  everything heals up to  normal   but not all the time  sometimes the wound closes with those basal layers comprising most of the  new  skin  probably depth of injury and whether or not it bleeds  if the wound is mostly superficial and does nt pool with blood  the scar tends to be shiny  if it bleeds  or the scrape is deep and the wound is open for a while  it tends to be dark and most often raised  source  experience  i got loads  both accidental and otherwise  i got so many different types myself  got this indented kinda scar on my head from splitting it open when i was young  got a couple  rope  scars where the skin is raised and bumpy  a couple different stitches left the shiny scars both with normal shiny skin and with dark shiny skin  my puncture wound was pretty interesting  it did the dark shiny smootb patch but over time went to normal skin shiny and smooth  almost all my burn scars are raised i m not sure if that relates to my surgery raised scars or not ,0
the confederate flag is a symbol that represents a time in american history when some states in the south wanted to leave the united states and form their own country because they wanted to continue the practice of enslaving black people many people view the flag as a symbol of racism and oppression and believe it should not be displayed in public however some people in the united states see the flag as a symbol of southern heritage and pride and believe they should be able to display it if they want to its important to remember that the flag represents a very painful and controversial part of american history and that it can be hurtful to many people,1
the law is divided into two parts  criminal and civil  illegal acts which are not criminal  called  torts  although i ve never heard of anyone call them that in real life  can not carry the same penalties as criminal offences  the court procedures are different and it may mean that it will not be a matter for the police  decriminalisation means taking a crime and making it still illegal  but turning into a civil wrong  not a crime  thus  in most jurisdictions anyway  it will no longer be possible to imprison someone for breaking the law in this way  it s done to things that  while still considered wrong  are no longer considered sufficiently wrong to have all the punishments and procedures that crimes have  as a result of a criminal action  the courts can order the loss of life  freedom  or property  in exchange for the right of the government to remove up to all three of these things  you are given certain rights  lawyer  trial  jury  etc   that does nt mean that the violation of a law is always a criminal act  some laws can still be broken  but the result is not a crime  for example  speeding  or in some places  possession of marijuana  the court will require less evidence to convict you  but you do nt have the fear of death as a result of your conviction  decriminalization puts it in the same category as a speeding ticket ,0

okay  so there are a sub  group of christians called  fundamentalists   they believe that the bible is  literally  true  and genesis says that the earth was created in 6 days  along with humans and all the animals  they were literally created  in six days  but evolution specifically says that animals  and since humans are animals  change and evolve over time from other animals  humans too would logically have developed from some sort of lower form of animal  this directly contradicts the  literal  interpretation of biblical creation  since evolution takes far longer than the 6 days  6000 years of human civilization  so that s the basic idea  in some areas of america  fundamentalists are extremely politically powerful  so they want to keep kids from learning about  dangerous  beliefs  because some people believe in religion more than evolution  if you get enough of those people together and they outnumber those who believe in evolution  they can pass a law getting it banned  i think a major factor is that people generally do nt understand what a scientific theory really is  because of this  they become insulted with their idea that evolution is nt a fact when it very much  is  a fact ,0

basically  it s impossible for anything to be 100  efficient  so it will always lose energy to that inefficiency  any sort of friction  heat  etc in the tiniest amount is a loss of efficiency  and thus a loss of energy  law of conservation of energy  in order for a machine to be in perpetual motion  it has to maintain the same amount of energy  but it will inevitably lose some due to friction and imperfections in energy transfer  with something strictly mechanical it s pretty easy to grasp  but i saw someone post on here an idea to use water pumps to power a hydroelectric generator  which would power the pumps  unless you have a fairly good knowledge of the efficiency of pumps and hydroelectric generators it s hard to work out exactly how much energy it would require  but a simple  law of conservation of energy  the pumps would require more power than the system would produce  explanation would be the best one in my opinion  perpetual motion requires no friction and no loss of energy  a system can only be called  perpetual  if it works forever   without adding more energy to the system    that s the reason it ca nt exist  we can not create a system that does not lose energy  if you have to add more  then the device can not work forever ,0

so far as we know  there s no relationship between the moon and the menstrual cycle  it s a coincidence  there s some indication it might be an evolutionary hold  over  in some species  ex  lemurs   sex occurs around the time of the full moon  there has nt been much conclusive evidence that this occurs in humans  so far as i m aware  not all women have a cycle of 28 days  some are shorter  some longer  some irregular  it is only approximately 28 days  the cycle is due to a rise and fall in hormones  there is no reason as far as i know why it is approx 28 days and not 3032  15  7  40 etc etc  however  i took many a biology class in college  and 28 days is likely the amount of time to balance the energy required to ovulate and the best frequency for getting pregnant  for example  if women ovulated every week  that s a lot of menses and eggs and tissue  if they ovulated every 3 months  they d save energy but it takes a long time to get pregnant  due to less episodes of a fertile egg  and lose time to have babies  of course  if the fertile period lasted longer  that would be ideal  but it did nt work out that way for us humans  also  many animals have mating cycles based on the moon  likely because its an easy way to tell  time   so it may be be a holdover from that  but i have no evidence  its just a theory  tldr  its 28 days because of hormones  but the specific duration actually varies among women  this 28 day average is likely an evolutionary balance between energy loss and chance of reproducing  do nt quote me on this  but i think it has something to do with werewolves ,0
imagine you have a water bottle that s a little leaky  so water leaks out constantly  you actively keep the water level up by refilling it all the time  now if you died  no one will refill this water bottle  so the water level will begin to drop  if i know what level you ve kept it at  and the rate at which the water level drops  i can tell when you ve stopped refilling it  and when you died  it s the same with carbon dating  carbon13 carbon14 is an isotope of carbon that decays at a known rate  your sample is considered to have a level of carbon13 carbon14 that is in equilibrium with its environment  and this equilibrium is not maintained when the organism dies  by knowing the equilibrium condition and the rate of carbon13 carbon14 decay  you can work back to when the equilibrium ceased to be maintained  elements are defined by how many protons are in their nucleus  for example  carbon has 6 protons in its nucleus  the same element  however  can have a varying number of neutrons  carbon can have 6  7  or even 8 neutrons  these are called isotopes and are designated by the total number of protonsneutrons  so the carbon with 6 neutrons is carbon12  the carbon with 8 neutrons is carbon14  the upper atmosphere is constantly being bombarded by enerjectic rays which can do funny things  like turn nitrogen14 into carbon14  carbon14 is radioactive and will  eventually  decay back into nitrogen14  the rate at which carbon14 is being created and the rate at which it is decaying is somewhat constant  meaning there is a predictable amount of carbon14 in the atmosphere  this carbon14 binds with oxygen creating co2 which is absorbed by plants which is eaten by animals who are in turn eaten by other animals  in other words  if you are a living organism  you are constantly consuming carbon14 which is then used in the building blocks of your body  the end result is the concentration of carbon14 in your body is the same as that of the atmosphere  but once you die  you stop taking in outside material and the carbon14 in your body will slowly begin to decay back into nitrogen14  the concentration of carbon14 decreases at a predictable rate  by comparing the concentration of carbon14 in a corpse  and comparing it to that of the atmosphere  we can calculate how long it has been dead  within certain ranges and margins of error  two carbons are mutually attracted to one another  one gathers up the courage to ask the other out  they both go for a lovely dinner and watch a funny movie after  later they get in bed and get as dirty as carbons can  the next morning one of the carbons wakes up alone with a note on their pillow that reads  you should get tested   and so the cycle of carbon dating continues ,0
cats bury their poop for a few different reasons one reason is to cover up the smell of their poop so that other animals wont be able to smell it and know that they are in the area this can help to protect the cat from predators because if other animals cant smell the cats poop they might not be able to find the cat another reason that cats bury their poop is to mark their territory cats have scent glands on their paws and when they bury their poop they are also marking the area with their scent this can help to keep other cats away from their territory overall the reason that cats bury their poop is to keep themselves safe and to mark their territory its something that they do naturally and is a part of their instinct,1

this link   url0  appears to verify that fire hydrants do exist in the uk  it appears that in the uk they are commonly marked by a yellow plaque bearing a black  h   and look like nothing more than a plain pipe instead of the iconic american  style fire hydrants and are probably located under a plate in the sidewalk or roadway in urban areas  because the uk uses a different system  one in which fire hydrants are carried by the firetrucks  a manhole cover is removed and the hydrant is placed  cheaper and less footprint  a bit more effort though  we do  they re under the little doors in the floor with h on them  also the concrete posts  usually painted yellow  with a black capital h on them mark their site ,0
because russia is incredibly corrupt  many of the people who were hired to build things deliberately stole some of the money  put too little resources into construction  and then lied and said that things were going well  i ve wondered the same thing  even with russia s views on gays and this new fetish for some old school soviet oppression  i was rooting for the olympics  and i get that it very hypocritical of me but i do like the winter olympics a lot  but on the subject  it seems that corruption has bleed out most of the money used to build the facilities  but on the other had the reports have only come from western reporters  any links on reports from inner europe and the east  still this thing looks to be one huge train wreck  just wait until this years  world cup and 2016 olympics  sochi is worlds ahead in this comparison ,0
hiroshima and nagasaki are both densely populated today because the levels of radiation in these cities have decreased significantly since the bombs were droppednnwhen a nuclear bomb explodes it releases a lot of energy in the form of radiation this radiation can be harmful to living things including people however over time the radiation levels in an area decrease as the radioactive particles that were released during the explosion decay this process of decay or halflife is different for each type of radioactive particle some particles may have a very short halflife while others may have a longer halflifennafter the bombs were dropped on hiroshima and nagasaki the radiation levels in these cities were very high and it would have been dangerous for people to live there however as the years passed the radiation levels decreased as the radioactive particles decayed today the radiation levels in hiroshima and nagasaki are similar to those in any other city and it is safe for people to live therennits important to remember that nuclear bombs are very powerful and can cause a lot of damage they should only be used in very rare and extreme circumstances and it is important to be very careful when working with nuclear technology,1
its normal for people of all genders to get an erection when they need to urinate this is because the bladder and the penis are located near each other in the body and sometimes the muscles in the bladder can put pressure on the penis which can cause an erectionrnrnerections can also be caused by sexual arousal which is when someone feels turned on this can happen to people of any gender and it usually involves feelings of desire or excitement when someone is sexually aroused their body responds by increasing blood flow to the genitals which can cause an erectionrnrnits important to remember that everyones body is different and what causes an erection or arousal can vary from person to person its also important to remember that its completely normal to have an erection or feel sexually aroused and theres nothing wrong with it,1
building a youtube app using html5 is not necessarily difficult but there are a few reasons why google might prefer apps to be built using native code rather than html5 one reason is that native code can often be more efficient and perform better than html5 this is because native code is specifically designed to work with a particular operating system and hardware while html5 is a crossplatform technology that needs to work on a wide variety of devices as a result native code may be able to take better advantage of the specific features and capabilities of a device which can lead to a faster and more seamless user experience another reason is that html5 is a webbased technology which means that it relies on an internet connection to work in contrast native code can work offline which can be important for certain types of apps or in situations where an internet connection is not available finally google might prefer apps to be built using native code because it allows them to have more control over the look and feel of the app as well as the features and functionality that are included this can be particularly important for an app like youtube which is a key part of googles business and needs to be tightly integrated with other google services and products i hope this helps to explain why google might prefer apps to be built using native code rather than html5,1
the first computer programs were actually written by hand using only pencil and paper there were no computers as we know them today so there was no way to run a program on a computer instead people would write out instructions for a machine to follow and then someone would manually execute each step of the program on the machineeventually people started to develop ways to represent these instructions in a more organized way using symbols and abbreviations to stand for different operations this made it easier to write and understand programs and it also made it possible to start using computers to execute the instructions automaticallyto write the first software the person would have needed to come up with a set of instructions that the computer could follow to solve a particular problem they would then write out these instructions using the symbols and abbreviations that were available at the time it was a very timeconsuming and difficult process but it was an important first step in the development of modern computing,1

there has been a lot of research on the effects of stock splits some studies have concluded that however note that i these are averages over large samples and does not say it will work on every split and ii most of the research is a bit dated and more recent papers have often struggled to find any significant performance impact after 1990 possibly because the effect has been well documented and the arbitrage no longer exists this document summarises the existing research on the subject although it seems to miss some of the more recent papers more practically if you pay a commission per share you will pay more commissions after the split than before bottom line dont overthink it and focus on other criteria to decide whenwhether to invest,0
p stands for  polnomial   a p problem is one that a computer can solve  quickly   which is to say  there s a particular limit to the amount of calculations the computer has to perform to solve the problem  np stands for  nondeterministic polynomial   it means that the computer can  check  a result in polynomial time  even if it ca nt necessarily find that result from scratch at a reasonable speed  think of it like doing a jigsaw  if you want to do a 1000000 piece jigsaw  it ll take you a while  if someone says they ve solved a 1000000 piece jigsaw  all they have to do is show you the completed picture  which will take a second or two  obviously all p problems are also np  because if you can solve something from scratch quickly you can just do that to check it  the big question is  are there np problems which are not also p   the experts believe there are  and they re pretty sure that a particular class of np problems called  np  complete problems  are not p  but they re not sure   here s the li5 version  in computer science  some problems are thought to be  easy  and some are thought to be  hard   easy problems can be solved fast  hard problems take a long time for a computer to solve  p is a class of problems that can be solved  fast   if the input is n bits long  then the problem can be solved in time proportional to a polynomial of n like n2  np is a class of problems that can be solved slowly  if the input is n bits long  then the problem can be solved in time proportional to an exponential of n  like 2n now  any problem that can be solved fast can obviously be solved more slowly  so we say that p is a subset of np  now  it could be that all problems in np  all these slow  hard problems  actually have some fast solution  if that s the case  we d say p  np because all problems that are in np are also in p all these hard problems are actually pretty easy  but most people think that p   np  that is  there are some  hard  problems for which there is no fast  easy solution  however  finding out whether p  np is the most famous unsolved problem in computer science  it has been awhile since i ve done any reading on this  so i m probably going to get some details wrong  a p or np problem is a task  the task could be sort through the names on a list in alphabetical order  or fill up a toy box so you can get the most toys inside as possible  if we want a computer to do this problem for us  we have to give it help  computers do nt know how to do anything unless we tell them how  with instructions we call programs  there are very smart people who study these programs  and have learned a lot about them  they ve learned that some problems  like sorting a list of names  can be solved in a predictable amount of time  these are p problems  now some problems ca nt be solved predictably  like putting a bunch of toys in a box so that all of them fit  unlike a p problem  where we give the computer a method to solve the problem  with an np problem the best we can do is tell the computer to try every possible option and stop when it finally gets it right  our best nerds have nt been able to create accurate predictions for these kinds of problems  and even have found evidence that we may never be able to predict how long an np problem will take to solve  the computer could get it right on the very first try  or it could take years  depending on the size of the toy box ,0
the manufacturers set the serving size  they are ridiculously small so they can put smaller numbers in the unhealthy parts of the nutritional information  because most people do nt think to check the serving size  just thought people would find this interesting  i was doing some baking last week and i needed some heavy cream  there were 32 servings in one single cup of heavy cream  50 calories in each serving does nt seem that bad until you realize how small the serving size is  serving sizes are based off of multiple surveys between the late 70s and 80s  which involved asking average people how much of a certain food they would typically eat  could it be that people ate less back then or lied to the surveys  perhaps  these surveys have nt been repeated though  so whenever a new type of food is created  the creators have to determine what type of food category it would fall under and then pretty much estimate  the important thing to remember  though  is that a serving size is not the same as a portion size  serving sizes are only used to tell you how many vitamins  calories  fat are in a specific size of the food that is somewhat relevant to how much you might be eating  it would be easier to simply say the dietary information for a the same amount of food every time  such as 1 cup  but if i m putting jelly on my toast  i would rather know the dietary information for the suggested serving size  1 tablespoon  instead of 1 cup  similarly  i have no idea how many cups make one slice of pizza  but if the serving size is two slices  i can easily do the math to figure out how many calories i am eating  tldr  they re just a standardized way to say the dietary information in a certain amount of food  you re not expected to be full after one serving size ,0

hypnosis is a technique in which a person is induced into a state of relaxation and focus in order to be more receptive to suggestion it is often used as a tool for therapy as it can help people overcome certain mental or behavioral challenges such as phobias anxiety or addictionnnthere is still some debate among scientists and researchers about how hypnosis works and what happens in the brain during hypnosis some theories suggest that hypnosis may change the way the brain processes certain kinds of information allowing people to respond differently to stimuli or to access memories that might otherwise be difficult to recallnnits important to note that hypnosis is not a magic cureall and that it can be ineffective for some people its also important to work with a trained and certified hypnotherapist to ensure that the process is conducted safely and effectively,1
keys are used to open locks by fitting into the specific shape of the locks mechanism the specific shape or pattern of the ridges and valleys on a key is called the keys bitting when you insert a key into a lock and turn it the bitting of the key interacts with the pins or wafers inside the lock in a specific way allowing the lock to openrnrnthere are a virtually unlimited number of possible bitting combinations that can be created so it is unlikely that we will ever run out of unique keys in fact there are already many different types of keys available each with its own unique bitting and new keys are constantly being designed and createdrnrnadditionally keys can be designed to open multiple locks such as master keys that are able to open several different locks within a single building or system these types of keys are used in situations where it is convenient to have one key that can open multiple locks but they are not as common as keys that only open one specific lock,1

sure a false positive means that something was identified as being a certain thing but it was actually not that thing for example if a medical test is supposed to identify whether a person has a certain disease a false positive would be when the test says the person has the disease but they actually dont non the other hand a false negative means that something was not identified as being a certain thing but it was actually that thing using the same example a false negative would be when the test says the person does not have the disease but they actually do ni hope that helps let me know if you have any other questions,1
it generally makes sense to consider the tax implications of investing in a particular security or asset as taxes can significantly impact your overall returns whether it is more advantageous to invest in a security in a country with dividend taxfree depends on a variety of factors including your personal tax situation and the specific details of the investment in questionif you are a resident of a country that imposes taxes on dividends it may be more advantageous to invest in a security in a country with dividend taxfree as you will be able to keep more of your returns however it is important to carefully consider the overall tax implications of investing in a particular security or asset as there may be other taxes that apply such as capital gains taxes or taxes on interest incomeit is also worth noting that the tax treatment of dividends and other investment income can vary significantly from country to country so it is important to research the specific tax laws that apply in the country where you are considering investing additionally it may be beneficial to consult with a tax professional or financial advisor to help you make informed decisions about your investments,1
it is difficult to determine the specific cause of fluctuations in blood pressure bp in a lung and liver cancer patient without more information there are many factors that can affect bp including cancer treatment medications and underlying health conditions cancer itself can also affect bp as it can lead to inflammation and other changes in the body that can alter bp additionally liver cancer and other forms of advanced cancer can lead to complications such as ascites fluid accumulation in the abdomen and malnutrition which can also affect bpnnit is important to note that fluctuations in bp can be normal especially in individuals with advanced cancer and do not necessarily indicate that the patient is close to dying it is always best to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate assessment of the patients condition and to discuss any concerns you may have,1
poison is an american glam metal band that achieved great success in the mid1980s to mid1990s  poison has sold over 30 million records worldwide and have sold 15 million records in the united states alone  the band has also charted ten singles to the top 40 of the billboard hot 100  including six top 10 singles and the hot 100 number  one single   every rose has its thorn   the band become icons of the  80s mtv era and have had widespread commercial success  the band s break through debut album  the multi platinum look what the cat dragged in was released in 1986 and they hit their peak with the second album  the multi  platinum selling open up and say  ahh  which became the bands most successful album ever  the popularity continued into the new decade with their third consecutive multi platinum selling album flesh  blood  in the 90 s following the release of the bands first live album swallow this live  the band experienced some line up changes and the fall of pop metal with the grunge movement  but despite the drop in popularity the bands fourth studio album native tongue still achieved gold status and the bands first compilation album poison s greatest hits  1986â€“1996 went double platinum  in the 2000s  with the original line up back together  the band found new popularity after a successful greatest hits reunion tour in 1999  the band began the new decade with the release of the long awaited crack a smile  and more   followed by the power to the people album  the band toured almost every year to sold out stadiums and arenas  they released a brand new album hollyweird in 2002 and in 2006 the band celebrated their 20 year anniversary with the best of poison  20 years of rock tour and album  which was certified gold and marked poison s return to the billboard 200 top 20 charts for the first time since 1993  band members have released several solo albums and starred in successful reality tv shows  after 25 years  the band is still recording music and performing  since their debut in 1986  they have released eight studio albums  four live albums  five compilation albums  and have issued 28 singles to radio   sauce   url0  first off  i m a chemistry undergraduate and not much of a biological one  as the name suggests  we do nt do much in the way of poisons  but my morbid fascination with them gives me a pretty good understanding of how some of them work  any poison kills or injures by interfering with the chemistry in your body by non  mechanical means  so ground glass is a thoroughly nasty thing to eat  but not poisonous   exactly how a poison screws up body chemistry obviously varies from substance to substance  but a lot of biological reactions only go fast enough to keep you alive because of enzymes  which are molecular machines made of protein that pull in reactant molecules and hold them together in such a way that they undergo the specific chemical reaction that the enzyme is meant to speed up much more easily than they would if they were nt in the enzyme  enzymes can be  inhibited  by other molecules going into the space where your reactants should be  and staying there because the molecule binds more strongly to the poison  which stops the machine from working  think of a bone jammed in a garbage disposal  you can get an orange out with the bone  but trying to get the bone out with the orange will be messy and  i was about to say fruitless  but that s probably a bad choice of word   this is called competitive inhibition  alternatively  a poison molecule can find a nice place to sit in the enzyme that s not where the reactants sit  but which changes the shape of the reactants  cavity  so they ca nt fit in properly  this is called non  competitive inhibition  an example of this is carbon monoxide or cyanide  co inhibits competitively the enzymes that transport oxygen around your body  haemoglobin  and cyanide competitively inhibits the enzymes in your cells that use oxygen to turn sugars into energy  it s a tiny bit more complicated than that irl   almost all poisons do what they do by inhibiting enzymes and stopping your body s chemical reactions from being able to keep you running  but there are a few exceptions  like too much water in your lungs  which does nt do anything to enzymes  it just stops you from being able to breathe  what kind of poison  nearly every type kills in a different way ,0
only 3  5 civilizations have ever invented a written language with absolutely zero input from anyone else  all other writing systems descend from or were inspired by one of these  definitively  writing systems developed in the middle east  sumerian for sure  possibly egyptian as well   china  bronze age glyphs   and mesoamerica  mayan   in all three cases  what you saw was urbanizations  meaning communities whose populations too big for a single individual or even a group of individuals to keep track of by memory  additionally  these were also the cases where enough of the population was in the same area  and recieving the same influences and education  for any given  code  to become widely used and understood  all languages are  in a sense  a code  the sender and the recipient must both understand the code a message is in for that message to be useful  if you do nt know the language  then the message is meaningless  cities marked the first time you had enough of a population in one area to support a group of people who have the time and inclination to study  codes  to communicate or store data  it perpetuated because it was also easy to share this information across large distances  as well as pass information  down  to future generations who might need that knowledge  most early writing systems were practical things  ie trade  family history  agricultural information  etc  then  they expanded to things like stories and histories  in villages  tribes  and other smaller communities  people usually only needed to keep track of what was going on in their immediate area  a single herd of animals  a single giant farm  or a collection of smaller farms   etc  meanwhile  stories or histories were preserved in oral tradition  which did require intense training and study  but preserved those stories and histories in someone s living memory  to be recited upon need or command  this was how information was preserved to pass  down  to future generations  if a community did not participate extensively in trade  they would ve had little need to communicate over long distances  so a system of spreading knowledge or information without an actual person to  carry  it from point a to point b  whether those points are across time  distance  or both  would never have been needed  writing is not the only way to store information without a living person to actually carry and distribute that information orally  there have been many  many artistic traditions that conveyed story and history without a word  meanwhile  there have historically been other mechanisms of storing and sharing more practical  day  to  day information like quipus   talking knots    however  over time  writing systems proved to be the most efficient and versatile way to store and share knowledge and information  so most of these other methods died out over time  even amongst writing systems  only a certain style really remains and prevails today  and that is the mechanism of using symbols to convey a  sound   and thus stringing together several symbols to convey a word   rather than symbol conveying a  word  or concept  the only major language that still uses the latter system today is chinese  and even this language is only partially logographic   pictures  symbols as words    and is also partially phonetic  characters or character alterations that convey sound  to combine with the logogram to convey the actual word or sentence correctly   and even now  chinese is evolving somewhat phonetically  simplified chinese is a little more phonetic and less logographic than traditional chinese  and many places even in china are more apt to just use western numerals than chinese ones  though the chinese numerals still prevail in the country   only about 3 civilizations in the whole world ever invented written language  it s  that  rare and extraordinary  all other civilizations got it by learning the idea from some other civilization that had it  or did nt get it at all  written language has always followed agriculture  since agriculture freed up so much time  early agriculture started around places dependent on relatively regular flooding  places like egypt and mesopotamia had brief times of harvest in tune with the cycles of the nile and the tigris and euphrates rivers  once cities were developed and grain was able to be stored  people had a lot more time to focus on  really whatever the hell else they felt like  at a certain point  elites in government or religious organizations wanted to be able to keep records  interestingly enough some cultures developed numeric systems faster than written systems  we ve found prehistoric records of tallys and the inca system of quipu was primarily for counting  the population of the new world arrived a lot later on the scene and because of their nomadic lifestyles  did nt adopt the same kind of storage systems that freed up time in the old world  obviously there are cool exceptions  like the maya  but most of the western hemisphere was populated with hunter gatherers and slash and burn agriculture that did nt lead to setting down and developing cities  when the land is abundant and plentiful  it s pretty easy to keep moving to follow game and find new fertile land  but as resources dwindle people tend to join together and stay put  mesopotamia had people for a loooooong time before written language showed up  and had definitely been slowly chipping away at the natural resources available  so agriculture on a large scale and bringing people together would have helped with the resource crunch and allowed for writing  the new world had less people for a shorter amount of time  so most cultures did nt experience shortages that would have prompted them to band together  once people without written language came into contact with cultures with writing  it s a lot easier to co  opt what was already done  written language

it is nt necessarily harmful  but it is nt good for the product  when things are frozen commercially  it is done in a way to make the ice crystals as small as possible  larger ice crystals will puncture the cells of the meat  causing the moisture to leak out when it is thawed  the smaller the ice crystal  the less damage is done to the meat during freezing and the less leakage you ll get when it is thawed  your home freezer freezes things much more slowly  causing large ice crystals to form  if you thaw a commercially frozen piece of meat it will be ok  but refreezing it at home and subsequently defrosting will kill the texture  ahoy  matey  yer not alone in askin   and kind strangers have explained  1   eli5 why ca nt you refreeze meat  or is that just a myth    url8  1   eli5  why should nt you refreeze foods that have thawed    url0  1   eli5  why is it bad to defrost and refreeze things like meat   url4  1   eli5  why should someone never refreeze something that has been unfrozen    url7  1   eli5  why ca nt you refreeze seafood after it has been frozen    url3  1   eli5  why ca nt we freeze food twice    url5  1   eli5 why you ca nt refreeze food   url1  1   eli5  why shouldnt you refreeze meat    url6  1   eli5  why is it a bad idea to freeze food that s been defrosted    url2  when you defrost meat  bacteria start reproducing   freezing meat does nt kill bacteria  it just stops them from reproducing as quickly   so if you defrost and refreeze  you have more bacteria overall   of course  heat kills bacteria  so  if you heat meat to a high enough temperature  it does nt matter how often you defrost and re  freeze  however 1  it s not going to taste as good  and 2  most people do nt heat meat to a sufficiently high temperature  there are always portions of the meat that are colder than the rest of the meat   so  with the added bacteria  the risk of bacterial infection increases ,0

in the modern society  a lot of dialect becomes a result of broader influences than just your immediate geographical surroundings  television has standardized quite a few american dialects  most americans watch network television which tends to use fairly standard dialects depending on their characters  the standard media dialect  the type of dialect that people often refer to as  not having an accent  is very much reinforced in formal broadcasts like news programs  this dialect is prevalent in the the midwest and west coast anyway  so there s a lot of it around  entertainment television and movies default to this dialect  too  but they ll have characters that they want to express a different regional identity  so they ll cast someone who has or can imitate a regional dialect  like for the movie  the departed  where several of the actors had boston accents  some more successfully than others   if you wanted to cast some one for a character that s from the south  you d likely have them use a southern accent  etc   edit  and to answer you question in regards to urban areas  they re the places that usually experience the most influence from television  movies  social media and which have the biggest mix of dialects  so someone living  growing up in an urban environment is more likely to end up with a standard dialect than any other particular one   edit 2and the african american dialect is particularly standardized  there is less variation among african american speakers than among almost any other major demographic  i spent years in seattle and years in boston  at least as far as white guys go  they do nt sound the same at all  that boston accent refuses to die  minnesota checking in  we sound nothing like the south here,0
have you looked at what is in that book value are the assets easily liquidated to get that value or could there be trouble getting the fair market value as some assets may not be as easy to sell as you may think the motley fool a few weeks ago noted a book value of 10 per share i could wonder what is behind that which could be mispriced as some things may have fallen in value that arent in updated financials yet another point from that link after suffering through the last few months of constant cries from   naysayers about the companyâ€™s impending bankruptcy shareholders of   penn west petroleum ltd tsxpwtnysepwe can finally look toward   the future with a little optimism thus id be inclined to double check what is on the company books,0
sure id be happy to explain some basic military strategies to you flanking is when a military force attacks from the side or rear rather than from the front this can be a effective strategy because it allows the attacking force to catch the enemy by surprise and to attack them from a direction that they may not be prepared to defend another basic military strategy is called encirclement or surrounding the enemy this can be effective because it cuts off the enemys supply lines and prevents them from receiving reinforcement or escape a third strategy is called infiltration or sneaking small groups of soldiers behind enemy lines to disrupt their operations and gather information this can be effective because it allows the attacking force to operate within the enemys territory without being detected i hope these explanations help let me know if you have any other questions,1
radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that can be found in some types of rock such as granite it is a colorless odorless gas so you cant see it or smell it when radon is present in the air we breathe it can be harmful to our health because it can damage the cells in our bodiesrnrnthe danger of radon comes from the fact that it can break down and produce tiny radioactive particles that can get trapped in our lungs when we breathe over time these particles can cause damage to the cells in our lungs and increase the risk of lung cancerrnrnthe amount of radon in the air can vary depending on where you live and the type of rock that is present in your area some areas have higher levels of radon than others in general it is believed that longterm exposure to high levels of radon can increase the risk of lung cancer but its important to note that not everyone who is exposed to radon will develop lung cancerrnrnthe media may say that radon is dangerous because it is a known cause of lung cancer while manufacturers may say otherwise because they may not want to discourage people from using their products or materials that contain radon it is important to be aware of the potential risks of radon and to take steps to reduce your exposure to it if you are concerned about your health,1
plastic school chairs often have holes in the back of them because they are designed to be lightweight and easy to carry the holes make the chairs lighter and more comfortable to sit in because they allow air to circulate around the back of the chair additionally the holes can help reduce the amount of heat that builds up in the chair which can make sitting in the chair for long periods of time more comfortable finally the holes can also help to reduce the amount of material needed to make the chair which can save money and resources so overall the holes in plastic school chairs are there to make the chairs more comfortable and easier to use,1
it s got to do with gravity  the moon s gravity pulls against everything on the earth s surface  most things are too stuck to the surface to be affected due to friction and just being attached solidly to the ground  large volumes of water are more malleable in this way  and so they tend to flow towards the moon  and when there s a landmass in the way  it creeps up against the landmass creating a high tide  tldr  the moon pulls at earth  and earth pulls at the moon with an equal force  the moon is not massive enough to move earth  so it affects the other objects and  stuff  on earth  which is our large bodies of water  longer explanations  i ve got three articles posted on tidal forces on my site  found  here   url1   start with  this   url0  article first  in physics  a body of mass is attracted to another body of mass  no matter this distance  if you were floating in space at one edge of the universe  and earth was at the exact opposite side  you would still be attracted towards earth s gravity  and the gravity your body mass has is pulling earth towards you  only at such a small amount that it s not even measurable at this distance  but it  is  affected  the water in the oceans basically sloshes around  back and forth  as the force of the moon s gravity pulls on it  the most important thing here is that the diameter of the earth actually creates a significant difference in the force of attraction felt by the water on the side closer to the moon vs the side further from the moon  the pull is stronger on the side closer to the moon so the water sloshes towards the moon  creating a high tide in that region  ,0
at the opening of any national convention  the first  vote  from the assembled delegates is to adopt the  rules  which govern how the convention will run and even set future rules for future contests  this is a hold over from the old days when state parties had all the power  now the national party does  and conventions actually decided nominations and not just elaborate 4 day tv commercials  the rules to be adopted this time included among other things  a refusal to recognise the delegates from the state of maine  where ron paul delegates got the majority but there are a lot of legal shenanigans about who won what were   and also included rules for future primaries which would ban tactics used by the ron paul campaign  the new rules say the delegates have to match the popular vote count  what rp supporters had been doing was going to state conventions and caucuses  where thier turnout was better and using arcane rules to increase their delegate count  its all very complicated and state by state  but the eli5 is  the rnc is trying to stop any future ron paul revolutions before they happen   now traditionally the  rules vote  is such a boring and procedural and uncontroversial thing that they do it by something called a voice vote  the speaker asks for  ayes  and  nays  and the loudest side wins  again usually everyone says aye  no one says nay  and they can move on with speeches and other  more tele friendly stuff  this time  with the controversial changes in the rules  when they called the voice vote  the ayes and nays sounded exactly the same  what supposed to happen is they pull out paper and start actually counting votes from the delegates  but john boener ignored this and stated the  ayes  won  the ron paul delegates and supporters relized that the rnc was going to force them out of the party s rule making process and that this was the elite s way of stopping any grass roots movement in the gop  so they flooded out of the convention and told as many reporters as possible about how the rnc was acting undemocratic and breaking their own rules and steamrolling regular party members  combine this with a series of legal battles over the results of many of the state caucuses  where ron paul supporters believed that mitt romney friendly state parties stole delegates from their totals by again  breaking rules  and that ron paul was only offered a speaking slot if he would let the romney campaign  vet   review and edit  his speech and give a full  unequivocal endorsement  and you ve pretty much pissed off all the ron paul people  adding onto what thisisntnamman said  the issues of louisiana and massachusetts caused controversy  in ma  ron paul won a bunch of delegates  but mitt romney won the majority  all the delegates would have to vote for mitt romney  because he won ma  both the romney and the paul delegates  however  the gop establishment did nt trust the paul delegates to vote for romney  so they forced the paulites to sign two affidavits  promising  that they d vote for romney  under the threat of perjury  however  many paul delegates refused  because they technically are legally able to still vote for ron paul  there was no party rule mandating them to sign the affidavit  so  the gop in ma just threw out the delegates that paul won and replaced them with romney delegates  in louisiana  something similar happened  when it became apparent that ron paul was getting a majority of the delegates  the romney people panicked and had the paul delegates arrested  even though they literally did nt do anything wrong  so yeah  there s the illusion of democracy for you  whenever the establishment sees that it s being threatened  it changes the rules  ron paul had a majority of delegates in a plurality  defined as 5  states  meaning that he could speak at the rnc  but at the last minute  the gop establishment  fearing a disturbance  changed the rules and redefined a  plurality  as 8  they gave ron paul the option to make a speech anyway  as long as it endorsed mitt romney and was approved by the gop  ron paul refused because he said that he does nt endorse romney  big surprise there   and that it would undermine all of his principles that he has been working for for the past 30 years  dear heavens  it s funny as shit to see the republicans turn on each other  it d be funnier  if the stakes were nt our nation s future ,0
journalists have a variety of tools and techniques they can use to find people some of these includesearching online journalists can use search engines social media and other online resources to find people and gather information about themusing public records journalists can request access to public records such as court documents property records and voter registration records to find people and learn more about themnetworking journalists often have connections within the communities they cover and they can use these connections to find people and sources of informationasking around journalists can also ask people they know if they have any information about the person they are trying to findcold calling sometimes journalists will simply call or email people they are trying to reach hoping to get a responseoverall the key for journalists is to be persistent and resourceful in their efforts to find people and gather information,1
the reason we use those symbols is because we need a way to explain how something is pronounced no matter what language it s spoken in  there are hundreds of languages in the world  and hundreds of possible sounds that are used in languages  that does nt mean they re completely different  there are lots of sounds that are used in almost all languages  but there are other sounds like the english  th  sound that are more rare  only a few languages use them  also  pronunciations change over time  even when spelling stays the same  notice how nursery rhymes have the word  again  rhyming with  rain   that s because many years ago   again  was pronounced differently  and it did rhyme with  rain   so it s important to have a way to talk about sounds in a way that does nt change over time  people who study language are linguists  in order to talk about all of the possible sounds  they came up with a set of symbols called the international phonetic alphabet  every symbol in this alphabet corresponds to an exact sound  it never changes over time and it never changes depending on what word it s in  each of these sounds is exact  there are hundreds of symbols in ipa  but it s not as hard as it sounds to learn  many of the symbols were chosen to look like english letters  and there are nt that many symbols you need to learn in order to read the pronunciation of any english word  there are lots of symbols you ll never encounter unless you study african languages  south asian languages  etc  one last thing  how do linguists define an ipa symbol  given that pronunciation changes over time  they do it by describing precisely how the sound is made in the human body  they describe where the tongue is  what shape the lips are in  and what is done with airflow  if someday in the distant future people stumbled across a reference book on ipa  they d be able to figure out hor to pronounce any word  even if they had no voice recordings from this century  is it just me  or does wikipedia need to implement a speech engine to pronounce the words whenever there is an ipa definition  i d rather hear it than looking at the alphabet soup and spending 5 minutes piecing it together from the tables  they re using the  international phonetic alphabet   url0   dê’  ipa is usually put between s to show it s a phonetic transcription  is the ipa symbol combination for the english sound  j  like  jam   the  j  sound is actually a combination of the  d  sound  and the  zh  sound  like the s in  treasure   ,0
phobos and deimos the two moons of mars were discovered by asaph hall an american astronomer in 1877 hall was working at the united states naval observatory in washington dc and he used a 26inch refracting telescope to observe mars he discovered phobos on august 18 1877 and deimos on august 12 1877 both moons were named after figures from greek mythology phobos which means fear was named after the son of ares the greek equivalent of the roman god mars while deimos which means terror was named after the son of the goddess aphrodite phobos and deimos the two moons of mars were discovered by asaph hall an american astronomer in 1877 hall was working at the united states naval observatory in washington dc and using a 26inch refracting telescope he was able to spot the moons during a series of observations he made of marsnnhalls discovery of the moons was a significant achievement as it was the first time that moons had been discovered around another planet since galileo galilei discovered the four largest moons of jupiter in 1610 the discovery of phobos and deimos also helped to support the idea that mars was a more complex and diverse world than previously thought and it played a key role in the development of modern planetary science the moons of mars phobos and deimos were discovered by astronomer asaph hall in 1877 hall was working at the us naval observatory in washington dc at the time and used a telescope to make the discovery phobos and deimos are both small irregularly shaped objects that orbit very close to mars phobos is the larger of the two moons and is named after the greek god of fear while deimos is named after the greek god of terror,1
because it creates life and the only sex capable of creating life is woman  a shit ton of cosmologies have earth goddesses  rather than earth gods  it s a pretty common archetype  the sumerians had tiamat  the greeks had gaia  romans had terra  hindus have prithvi  the notion of  mother earth  or  mother nature  is incredibly common globally  i think it derives from the earth being life  giving  productive  etc  females are the ones that produce new life as well as  traditionally  sustain existing life through their care  thus  earth becomes identified with fertility and women ,0
charcoal is made by heating wood in a low oxygen environment this process called pyrolysis removes water and volatile compounds from the wood leaving behind a material that is mostly carbon because the volatile compounds have been removed charcoal does not burn as easily as woodnnhowever when you expose charcoal to oxygen it can catch fire and burn this is because the carbon in the charcoal is still able to react with the oxygen in the air to produce heat light and other products of combustionnnthink of it like this when you burn wood you are using up the energy stored in the wood but when you make charcoal you are removing some of the energy from the wood and storing it in the charcoal when you burn the charcoal you are releasing that stored energy,1
they mean a bunch of different things  a dj usually refers to someone who plays music at parties  nightclubs  bars  etc  or it can refer to the guy on the radio who plays music  it has nothing to do with  making music   with the popularity of electronic music  dj can also refer to  an electronic artist  this is someone who writes  composes  and performs music using a computer  it can also refer someone who plays samples in a band or rap group  music producer can refer to the actual record producer in charge of the business side of making records  music producer can refer to an audio engineer who runs the technical side of making music  music producer can also refer to an electronic musician  music producer can sort of refer to any artist who makes music  a producer does for music what a director does for a movie or film  they decide what gets recorded  how it gets recorded  what songs will go on a record and how to mix the instruments together in the final recording  basically he directs the production of the recordings  ted templeman  a very famous producer said that his job was to take the best a artist has to offer and get it recorded and ready for sale to the public  this requires someone with a good ear  a good business sense  and knowing what people will like of what a particular artist can do  many times the way an artist sounds before and after being produced is drastically different because the artist ca nt be objective  whereas a producer can  good producers make artists better  a dj is the person at a party who is playing the music  and the producer is the one who made the music  that s about as simple as i can describe it  hope it helps ,0

it works like this  all possible states of the universe exist at once  time is a path through those possible states  if i flip a coin   there is a universe where it lands heads and a universe where it lands tails  you might think that your do nt know which one you are in until you observe the result  but it s more the  split  in the timeline does not happen at all until you observe the result  the coin is both heads and tails until it is observed   this example does nt really work because coin flips are not truly random  radioactive decay  however  is  this randomness powers the shcrã¶dinder s cat thought experiment   observing  is nt as passive an action as you think  in order for you to see something with your eyes  light has to have bounced off of it  in order for you to hear something with your ears  it has to have vibrated the air somehow  to observe particles on a quantum level  you need to bounce something electrons usually off of it  that act is what performs all the crazy quantum stuff that results from  just  observing  say you put a pot of water on the stove and you want to know how hot it is  the only way to do this is to stick a thermometer in it  however  assuming that the thermometer is cooler than the temperature of the water  sticking the thermometer in will lower the temperature of the water  in this scenario  it s impossible to know the exact temperature of the water since the act of looking up the temperature changes it ,0
the uvula is a small fleshy piece of tissue that hangs down from the roof of your mouth right in the middle its actually a part of your throat and it has a few important jobs first the uvula helps to keep your mouth and throat moist it produces a special type of liquid called saliva which helps to keep your mouth and throat from getting too dry second the uvula helps to keep food and drink from going down the wrong pipe when you swallow your uvula moves up and touches the back of your tongue this helps to close off the airway and prevents food and drink from going down the wrong pipe and into your windpipe which leads to your lungs finally the uvula also plays a role in speech it helps to make some of the sounds that we use when we talk such as the oo sound in boot or the ah sound in father so the uvula is a very important part of your body that helps to keep you healthy and helps you to speak clearly,1
great question the first day of a season is determined by the earths orbit around the sun the earth is tilted on its axis which means that different parts of the earth are closer to the sun at different times of the year this is why we have seasons the first day of fall also called autumn is september 21st because on that day the sun appears directly above the equator which means that the length of day and night are almost exactly the same all over the world the first day of winter is december 21st because on that day the sun appears directly above the tropic of capricorn which is a line of latitude that is located south of the equator this means that the suns rays are hitting the earth at a much lower angle so its colder the first day of spring is march 21st because on that day the sun appears directly above the equator again this marks the beginning of spring in the northern hemisphere where its usually cold in the winter and the beginning of fall in the southern hemisphere where its usually warm in the winter the first day of summer is june 21st because on that day the sun appears directly above the tropic of cancer which is a line of latitude that is located north of the equator this means that the suns rays are hitting the earth at a much higher angle so its warmer does that make sense,1

check  this   url0  out conservative and liberal are political theories  each of these theories have different views on the economic  social  and moral elements of a country and life in general    economic elements    conservatives are more in favour of true capitalism and free market  that means they believe that the government should not interfere with business  they believe that the more money that businesses make  the more money will trickle down to everyone else  besides big businesses  conservatives allow more economic freedom for regular citizens by trying to keep taxes low  conservative governments do nt spend too much on individual citizens  liberals believe in a more controlled economy  they believe that there should be more laws and limitations  such as pollution laws  to how business operates  liberals also believe that certain  more essential businesses  should be run by the government instead of regular people  liberals also believe that the government should help fund people that ca nt afford things  liberal governments believe that the government should pay for healthcare  education  unemployment security and other such benefits  left wing governments will pay more money per person  and so will generally have higher taxes    social elements    conservatives are more safety orientated types and are more concerned with their own citizens than others  they believe that the government should take an active role in protecting the people from threats both foreign and domestic  conservatives believe in stronger police forces  harsher penalties for crimes  death sentences   more restrictive immigration laws  and a stronger military  liberals are more freedom orientated  they believe the government should protect the rights of people  both in and out of the country  so  they endorse alternate methods of incarceration  allow more immigrants  fight for individual rights in foreign parts of the world  and will keep military spending low    moral elements    conservatives are more morally strict  typically  conservatives come from a more religious background  they disagree with drugs  prostitution  crime in general  abortion  porn  and all similar elements  a serious conservatives would strive to have all these elements made illegal  conservatives might also try to make religion a more important part of society  liberals are not as morally strict  they generally believe that all the elements above should be legalized so that the people can decide what is right and wrong by themselves  liberal believe in the separation of church and state  just so you know  not every person is a total conservative or a total liberal  in reality  i believe that most people believe in many elements from both sides  for example  someone might prefer conservative economics but not conservative morality    right wing vs left wing    generally speaking  a right winger is a person that has more conservative beliefs  and a left winger has more liberal beliefs  they re just different names of the same thing  the right and left names came from the french revolution  in the estates general  assembly of representatives   the conservative types sat to the right of the deputy while the liberal types sat to the left    republican vs democrat    these are the two main political parties in the usa  the republican is more mostly conservative  right wing while the democrats are mostly liberal  left wing  the main first step with this is that for the most part these six words refer to four main concepts  the united states more or less has a two party system  the democrats and the republicans  there are other theoretical independent parties  but they do nt really end up getting many congressmen or senators  therefore  the country is pretty much polarized between these two  hence left wing and right wing as polarized ideas   the democratic party  with obama as the incumbent president  represents left wing or liberal ideals while the republican party  with a myriad of candidates including romney  santorum  gingrich  and paul  represents right wing or conservative ideals  the main basis of the split generally has to do with social issues versus fiscal responsibility  in the past  democrats have been all for social issues  providing health care  ensuring education  etc   while the republican party has been more aimed towards fiscal issues  balance the budget  increase the money in american s pockets  etc    the core difference is that republicans believe that more money in citizen s pockets is better while democrats believe that the government can provide services that outweigh the lost money  although this is basically the main core difference  there also tends to be separation on many other issues  in general  the republican platform is pro  life  against gay marriage  and pro  tax cuts for the rich and upper to middle class while the democratic platform tends to be pro  choice  for gay marriage  and more likely to tax the wealthy  there has been recently quite a bit of confusion on account of neo  cons  republicans who have re  imagined the party for a more social  issue based approach  most republicans are for decreased welfare and funding for education in order to maintain or improve the financial system as a whole  neo  cons are far more likely to be against welfare and want to decrease funding for education on religious or moral principles  the welfare are skating by while we work  schools are only teaching liberal garbage that twists what the founding fathers want  etc   the bush administration has been characterized as being neo  conservative as has the tea party movement which includes the media favorite sarah palin  does this help at all  hopefully it does  but if not i can try to clarify  our election campaigns are very interesting to keep up with  but it does take some figuring out    tldr  democrats are liberal and left wing  they like social issues and believe money for the poor in the form of welfare is necessary  republicans are conservative and right wing  they like financial stability and believe wealth to the rich will help everyone   ,0

bail is a system that allows people who have been arrested to temporarily leave jail while they wait for their trial if someone cant afford to pay the full amount of their bail they might be able to pay a bail bondsman a smaller nonrefundable fee to post bail for them nthe amount of bail that a person must pay is usually determined by a judge or a bail schedule which is a list of standard bail amounts for different types of crimes the judge or bail schedule will consider the seriousness of the crime the defendants criminal history and whether the defendant is considered a flight risk meaning they are likely to run away and not come back for their court date nsometimes wealthier people can afford to pay higher bail amounts because they have more money this can make it easier for them to get out of jail while they wait for their trial however its important to note that everyone has the right to a fair trial and to be treated equally under the law regardless of their wealth,1
yes there is a finite amount of water on earth the water cycle is the process by which water moves around on earth water evaporates from oceans lakes and other bodies of water rises into the atmosphere and then falls back down to earth as precipitation such as rain or snow this water can then be absorbed by plants or run off into rivers lakes or oceanswater can also change form from a liquid to a solid freezing or from a solid to a liquid melting for example when it gets cold outside water in rivers lakes and oceans can freeze forming ice when it gets warm again the ice will melt back into wateroverall the amount of water on earth remains the same but it is constantly moving around and changing form as part of the water cycle,1
there are a few types of home loans in canada that may be easier to qualify for depending on your financial situation and credit history here are a few options to considerfederal government programs the canadian government offers several programs that can help make home ownership more accessible such as the firsttime home buyer incentive which provides a shared equity mortgage to help firsttime buyers with a down payment and the home buyers plan which allows you to use your rrsp as a down paymentlowdownpayment mortgages some lenders offer mortgages with a down payment as low as 5 of the purchase price which can be a good option for borrowers who dont have a large down payment saved up however these loans may have higher interest rates and require mortgage default insurance which can increase the overall cost of the loaninsured mortgages if you have a down payment of less than 20 of the purchase price you may be required to purchase mortgage default insurance this insurance protects the lender if you default on your mortgage and it can make it easier to qualify for a mortgage even if you have a lower credit score or a smaller down paymentflexible underwriting some lenders offer flexible underwriting which means they may consider factors beyond your credit score and debttoincome ratio when evaluating your mortgage application this can include your employment history savings and other financial assetsits important to shop around and compare different mortgage options to find the one that best meets your needs its also a good idea to work with a mortgage broker or financial advisor who can help you understand your options and guide you through the homebuying process in canada there are several types of home loans that may be easier to qualify for depending on your financial situation and the type of property you are looking to purchase here are a few options to considergovernmentinsured mortgages if you are a firsttime homebuyer or have a low down payment you may be able to qualify for a governmentinsured mortgage these mortgages which include the canada mortgage and housing corporation cmhc mortgage are backed by the government and may have more lenient eligibility requirementsflexible down payment mortgage some lenders offer mortgage products that allow you to put down a smaller down payment typically between 5 and 10 of the purchase price these mortgages may be easier to qualify for if you dont have a large down payment saved upalternative lending options if you have difficulty qualifying for a traditional mortgage due to credit or income issues you may be able to qualify for an alternative lending option these may include private mortgages cosigner mortgages or renttoown agreementsits important to note that while these options may be easier to qualify for they may also come with higher interest rates and fees so its important to carefully consider all of your options and choose the mortgage product that is right for you,1
what you are describing is a version of zeno s paradox  from wiki   zeno states that for motion to occur  an object must change the position which it occupies  he gives an example of an arrow in flight  he states that in any one instant of time  the arrow is neither moving to where it is  nor to where it is not  it can not move to where it is not  because no time elapses for it to move there  it can not move to where it is  because it is already there  in other words  at every instant of time there is no motion occurring  if everything is motionless at every instant  and time is entirely composed of instants  then motion is impossible   these paradoxes do nt really have a concrete answer  some claim to have worked out the formula  according to the wiki  but this seems to be taking the fun out of it   they are meant as philosophical thought experiments  a  second  is not actually time  a second is a second  a second passes  but time itself is not constrained by the tyranny of what a second is  the same as the concept of length itself is not constrained by meters or feet  each moment is the now  you can not subdivide the now  the now could be conceived of as the absolute smallest increment of time  kin to electrons or quarks  assuming  of course  nothing lies beneath  those    a second could be expressed as a near  infinite string of nows  if you would like  which the universe processes at its own speed  the mistake you are making is assuming that your processing speed is the same as the universe s  assuming it processes time the way your brain does  lingering on moments as they exist  it does not  the universe processes time  we perceive  some of  the results  the smallest measurable unit of time is  plank time   url0   without going into technical detail  many physicists believe that time and matter are not infinitely divisible  string theory   also  time is nt necessarily a thing  we define time by physical events like the vibrations of an atom or the sun rising and falling  if nothing physical happened  did time really pass  how would you measure it  time is only changes of our universe ,0
moving averages are a technical analysis tool that help smooth out price action by filtering out the noise from random price fluctuations there are several ways to analyze moving averages includingidentifying trend a rising moving average indicates an uptrend while a falling moving average indicates a downtrendcrossover signals a golden cross occurs when a shortterm moving average crosses above a longterm moving average indicating a potential uptrend a death cross occurs when a shortterm moving average crosses below a longterm moving average indicating a potential downtrendsupport and resistance moving averages can act as support or resistance levels with prices finding it difficult to break above or below the moving averagedynamic support and resistance the slope of the moving average can also provide insight into the strength of the trend a steep slope indicates a strong trend while a flat or declining slope suggests a weakening trendits important to note that moving averages should not be used in isolation but rather in conjunction with other technical analysis tools and fundamental analysis,1
in my experience linux users are often reluctant in mentioning this in front of linux  fledgelings  but here it is  anyway  linux is built to make tinkering easy  windows and osx are commercial  so the developers want to make it hard to copy it and hard to change the basical stuff  changing too much stuff might break your os   the points mentioned in this thread are valid  linux is free and the softwarepackages make it safe and easy to install and find things you need  but most people i know  who use linux  spent an amount of time on customising their os  that is quite worth mentioning  so far i have not found a way to handle windows with keyboard only  with linux it s a bit crafting and coding  but it s possible  and when you re using a laptop with a shitty little touchpad  this is really a good thing  also linux comes as a puzzle  that is presolved  but you can still exchange tiles if you want to  but there is not only this option  there are also tiles  that you can just choose from without having to make them  new os s often come with a giant pile of funny extras  mainly grafical ones  they eat up your batterycharge like nothing  windows has the option to shut most of them down  more or less  but sometimes this requires a lot of searching through your system settings  the linux  community offers many different desktop  environments and most of them are performance  friendlier than windows could ever be   i do nt know about osx here  so i ll just leave that out   about personal experience  i use linux for basically everything except playing and painting  now that i have a small collection of linux  games  that might change as well  but my graphic  tablet still does nt seem to like linux  so i ll still keep one windows running on one computer  i hope i can fix that one day  many variations of linux are free  there are fewer viruses affecting linux than windows  unlike osx  it can run on most hardware   most web servers are linux  one major downside is that there is less commercially available software for linux and it will probably take more effort to make sure your hardware is compatible  i use osx for my primary work  pleasure computer  i use linux for my servers   i know i m making a lot of generalizations here  but i really do nt want to get into a fight about what os is better  i use it for home and for work  working from home  that is   the better things in linux are too complex to explain to non  users most of the time  one of the biggest advantages to using linux on the desktop is the packaging system  that is a central repository where all software is stored  the repository is constantly updated when new software comes out  so  instead of navigating to a website  downloading an installer  running it  and rebooting to get software you could just run sudo apt  get install firefox there are hundreds of thousands of software packages available for download this way  another advantage is x11  the server that provides a graphical framework  this is a plus because multiple desktop environments exist that completely change the way you use your computer graphically  gnome and kde are two popular ones if you wanted to research them  other niche window managers exist if you need to do a particular purpose  like use your computer without a mouse  they can be installed just like any other software  from the repository  there are also the non  technical bonuses  linux is free  in both senses  free as in price and free as in freedom  because of the license    also  linux is extremely resistant to viruses because of its obscurity and its user group system  also  if you use the command line linux  bsd are the only ways to go  you never have to use it  but if you learn it  and it s easy to learn  it will be a great tool  on windows or os x if the desktop environment crashes  you have to restart  if you know the command line on linux you can shut down the rogue process and regain control of your computer  the only issues you may encounter are drivers  the community makes drivers and sometimes companies provide their own drivers  windows programs can be run through a compatibility layer called wine  so most of the times that is not an issue ,0
android is an operating system that is used by many different phone manufacturers such as samsung htc and lg these companies make their own custom skins or user interfaces for their phones in order to differentiate their products from other android phones and to offer their own unique features and design one reason that these companies make their own skins is because they want to offer their customers a unique and differentiated experience a custom skin allows a phone manufacturer to add features and design elements that are not available in the stock version of android for example samsungs oneui skin includes features like bixby a digital assistant and a special night mode another reason that these companies make their own skins is because they want to have more control over the look and feel of their phones by creating their own skins these companies can decide exactly how their phones will look and how they will function rather than relying on the stock version of android while some tech journalists and users may prefer the stock version of android other users may prefer the custom skins offered by these companies because they offer additional features and a unique user experience ultimately the decision to use a custom skin or the stock version of android is a matter of personal preference,1
bagels and donuts have holes because they are made that way people have been making bagels with holes in the middle for a long time the hole in a bagel helps it cook more evenly as the middle of the bagel takes longer to cook than the outside it also makes the bagel easier to slice in half for sandwichesdonuts also have holes in the middle for a similar reason the hole in the middle helps the donut cook evenly and it also makes it easier to hold and eatwhile it is possible to make bagels and donuts without holes they are typically made with holes because it makes them easier to cook and eat,1
watergate itself was actually an office complex  it was the host of the watergate scandal in the 1970 s  in that office was the headquarters of the democratic national party  president nixon was up for election for his second term  he is a republican  and was the incumbent  already president going for re  election   suddenly  in 1972  5 people were arrested for breaking into the democratic national party s hq with ties to the cia and other government organizations  they were planting surveillance equipment  such as microphones  to record what was going on in there  obviously  people suspected nixon had a hand in the break  in  but nothing was tied to him originally  eventually  a mysterious informant named  deep throat  provided evidence to news reporters that nixon actually  did  know and had a hand in the watergate break in  which is not only highly unethical but illegal as well  this prompted a national outcry against the president and impeachment proceedings by congress  many high  level politicians and officials were indicted for various crimes relating to watergate  eventually  in 1974  president nixon said  screw this whole mess  and resigned  his vice president  gerald ford  then gave nixon a presidential pardon  which gave him immunity for the crimes he was going to be tried for  watergate was an ultra right wing coup to unseat a president that was taken up by the liberal press and the democrats  this is why 40 years later there is no suspicions of the ultra right  nixon won by over 60   all the southern states and all but two us states  a landslide  but he had upset many stakeholders especially those in the china lobby and the military industrial complex with his rapprochement with china  stopping the vietnam war and the salt talks with the then ussr  if he had done all that in his first term what might he do in his second when he has such a huge majority  was what he did any worse than lbj s gulf of tonkin incident confabulation that led to the escalation of the vietnam war from 25000 military advisors to 500000 us servicemen and women  then there was the famous reagan iran  contra fiasco when he forgot the details of what happened  clinton s monica lewinski moment  and g w bush s wmd and the illegal iraq war for regime change   yet none of them were hounded to resign  why  facts are quickly and conveniently forgotten  eg how many remember that the watergate culprits were arrested at their third attempt at break  in  were they courting arrest  h hunt s details were in the address books of two of the four arrested cuban ex  cia operatives  the raids were amateurish and laughable if their consequences were not so serious  read my book  watergate  the political assassination  with an open mind to discover what may have actually happened  did those who confessed and jailed suffer from mass stockholm syndrome  strangely  nixon and bob haldeman had always denied being guilty  i was never a supporter of nixon but the official story had never sat well with me  he was a us patriot lamenting the 45000 us dead but had not a word for the 3 million vietnamese that he killed  he was also known to be a very astute political operator  would he have ordered the break in when at the time he was already 26 points of his rival  senator mcgovern  however  the official version is so ingrained in the us mass psyche that no amount of  facts  will change the story  nixon would rather resign than to see his beloved us of a torn asunder  the country was so divided by the war at that time  before accepting my version  go back and read the original sources  it had been claimed that there are too many documents to digest  read the key ones  republicans hired burglars to break in to a main democrat office  the purpose of this break  in was to gather intelligence  and install listening devices  so as to give the republicans an unfair advantage during the elections  the burglars got caught  and this led to a big investigation  which uncovered a number of illegal activities against the democrats  and implicated president nixon  it was important to the us because it opened the public eye to the reality of election cheating ,0

mice are often used in scientific research because they are small easy to care for and have a relatively short lifespan they are also genetically similar to humans which makes them useful for studying diseases that affect humans such as cancer in addition there are many strains of mice that have been genetically modified to develop specific diseases which makes it easier for scientists to study these diseases and test potential treatmentsrnrnit is important to note that all animal research is regulated by laws and guidelines that are designed to minimize harm to the animals and ensure that they are treated humanely researchers must follow these guidelines and obtain approval from an institutional review board before conducting any experiments involving animalsrnrnpeta people for the ethical treatment of animals is an animal rights organization that advocates for the ethical treatment of all animals including those used in scientific research peta and other animal rights groups often protest the use of animals in research arguing that it is unnecessary and cruel however many scientists and medical professionals believe that animal research is an important tool for advancing medical knowledge and developing new treatments for diseases,1
bloodtypes refer to the proteins found on the surface of blood cells  a and b are the 2 different proteins  ab means you have them both  o  zero  oh  cells have no proteins at all  being given the wrong type can cause problems because of the body destroying the foreign cells rendering the transfusion useless while the activation of the immuunsystem  which destroys the blood cells cells  can actually kill you  this is important when you need bloedtransfusion  in practice this means ab can receive everything  a can get a and 0b gets b and 0 and 0 gets only 0  this is also the reason bloodbanks are happy with 0 because it s universal  now as for the function   the functions are varied and include membrane structure  transport  receptor  adhesion  enzyme activity  complement components  complement regulation and glycocalyx formation   url0 also you have the resus factor which can be either there or not  positive or negative  i did nt see any answers to your question about other animals having blood types  but the answer is that yes they do  in fact  the rh factor  the  or   is named after the  rhesus macaque   url0   which some studies were originally done on  several people have explained what blood types are  evolution is the reason we have different blood types  there are different advantages  disadvantages between that come with the different blood types  although most of the time they are minor and go largely unoticed  however  a major example is the plague  and also a great example of co  evolution   the bubonic plague in europe during the middle ages primarily affected people with the blood type b  the most common blood type at the time  subsequently  many people with blood type b died and blood type o became the most common blood type  however  the bacterium responsible for the plague has since evolved  and the modern plague is more likely to affect people who are blood type o,0
modern guns would fire  older ammunition would lack oxidizer necessary to fire   1  the kickback would make you move  assuming you re doing this spacesuit style  so  you wo nt move fast  but you also will have to exert energy to not keep going forever  so  youd want to be careful  2  got ta be careful if you re in orbit  that bullet might be in orbit too and you d then potentially shoot yourself  your ship  your fellow astronaut  etc  that d be embarrassing  3  i m not sure about international laws about weapons in space  let s not enter the topic of gun control in this thread   on the other hand  would nt aiming be pretty much impossible i m not sure what you mean  once you adjusted your scope  sights to stop accounting for ballistic drop  the bullet would simply hit slightly lower than the point of aim  a bullet fired in space will take on a ballistic trajectory just like it would on earth  it will always follow gravity  that trajectory could differ quite a bit depending upon the relative motion after it s fired  for instance say that you are in low earth orbit  and for the sake of argument  firing the gun would nt send you catapulting off into space  if you fired along the vector you were traveling  the bullet would travel forward but also up as it s orbital velocity would be higher than yours  the end result is it would ascend to a higher and more elliptical orbit  if you fired retrograde  or backwards from the direction you were traveling  the bullet would take on a lower orbit and fall down and likely burn up in the atmosphere  if you fired at a 90 degree angle from your vector  the bullet would continue to orbit the earth but it s orbital path would vector to the side and orbit processionaly more like a spy satellite  if you fired directly  up  away from the planet  the bullet would take on a very elliptical orbit but still remain in orbit  if you fired  down  towards the earth  it would also take on a highly elliptical orbit but if you were already scraping the atmosphere it might be dragged down and re  enter the atmosphere as a meteorite  the thing though is that every action has an equal and opposite reaction  if you fired a gun while floating in space it would thrust you in the opposite direction and also send you spinning wildly out of control  as if you got hit in the shoulder and went tumbling  even if you somehow managed to fire so that the force of the shot went to your center of mass  it would still propel you away with considerable force  making a second shot nearly impossible  if you were simply in low gravity like on the moon  it would probably knock you over  and you could actually use a gun as a form of propulsion  jump up in the air and fire a volley of shots down towards the ground  and you would soon find yourself pretty high up  the bullets fired parallel towards the lunar surface would immediately begin gaining altitude as their ballistic trajectory would cause them to go into orbit  in orbital situations  going faster means going up  and going slower means going down  so if you want to make something get higher  you do nt thrust up  you thrust forward  and if you want to make it go lower you do nt thrust down you thrust retrograde or backwards to slow down  as far as the damage it would do  you would nt need to fire the gun at all in order to do damage  you need only grab a handful of bullets and let go  the speed that an object orbits the earth varies depending on how high or low it is in orbit  at low earth orbit  you are already travelling many times faster than a speeding bullet  shooting the gun would have a negligible impact on the over all speed in terms of kinetic power  18500mph vs 19200mph is not as great as 0mph vs 700mph  at those speeds even a chip of paint has enough energy to blow a hole clean through an astronaut ,0
the key word is  magnetic  resonance imaging  there s a giant magnet spinning around the machine  if you bring a steel anything anywhere near an mri machine  it ll get pulled towards the magnet  slamming into the machine s outer case with incredible force  if you re between the steel thing and the machine  you re not going to have a good day  the force of the object slamming into the machine is also likely to damage the machine leading to a rather expensive repair  the mri machine is comprised of a large magnet  and just like any magnet will attract metallic objects  which is why no metallic objects are allowed in the vicinity of the mri machine  the strength of magnets is measured in tesla  1 tesla is equal to 10000 gauss  and most mri machines in the field are of 15 t  3 t magnets are also seen   to put that into perspective  the earth â€™s magnetic field is approximately 05 gauss  so 15 t magnet is equal to 15000 gauss  approximately 30000 times the magnetic field of the earth   once a magnet is engaged  it s quite a task  expensive and time consuming  to stop and start it again  so if a patient is wheeled into the mri room with a regular wheelchair or an oxygen cylinder  it s simply sucked in and can cause injury or death  while using it  do you mean  what does it do to the image  ferromagnetic and paramagnetic particles such as welding spits  steel shavings in metalworkers  skin and anything like that  create a  black blob   this is a zone of no information slightly larger than the metal object which is usually rendered on the final image as just black  depending on the software  this also is the case for some paramagnetic  diamagnetic metal implants that might be in bone or teeth or a pacemaker etc  in addition  as other have stated  they can be magnetically attracted to the machine  but they do nt  slam into the machine   if possible  they will  want  to be in the axis of the central core  ie in the centre of the  tube  inside the main  ring   the magnetic  pull  can be enough to displace a small item  that is to say  tear it through your body  the microscopic bits of metal that can get in the cornea of metalworkers from filing and so on  if they got round the side of your safety glasses  can  in some cases  track their way through the eyeball  causing damage  active devices like pacemakers can be destroyed catastrophically  and you do nt want that  this is why the radiology staff insist that you disclose all bits and bobs that are in you ,0

a good introduction to the concept   url0   particles are not thought to be aware  particles can exist in a state that is  indeterminate   meaning that it can not be predicted how they will act  no matter how good your predictions are  observation of a particle means that you must interact with it in some way  eg shine a light at it   and this interaction makes the particle stop being indeterminate in the way it was before  there is no way to determine beforehand what option the particle will take when you shine a light on it  making it truly random  there are different theories about how this happens  but the fact remains the same  an implication for day  to  day living might be a  true random number generation   url1  which can not be achieved by traditional computing technology alone  any explanation of quantum mechanics in eli5 will be woefully lacking in information  but i ll do my best  some things  well  all things  on a sub  atomic level  exist in a state of superposition  that is  they are doing  in more than 1 place at once  but when we observe it  it has to pick 1 place  shit is funky on that level  the biggest implication of this in daily lives i can think of  its quantum computing  which takes advantage of objects that can be more than 1 thing at a time  a traditional bit has 2 states  on or off  a quantum bit can be 70  on  and 30  off  or anything in between  here s the eli5 version  quantum particles are not reacting to observation they are reacting to the interaction with other particles  in order to observe a particle  there must be a chain of interactions between that particle to another particle and so on  eventually all the way to you  the  spooky  results of quantum mechanics which can be quite poorly phrased as a particle  reacting to being observed  are much better phrased as depending on the chain of possible interactions between the particle and you ,0

you mean tv shows  like how we ca nt get on the daily show youtube channel in the uk  it s largely because once you ve made your programme in your native country  you can then sell the broadcast rights to channels in other countries  when you ve got a show to sell  the price will be much higher if you can go to the negotiating table and say   this is a very popular show  and nobody in your country will have seen these episodes  they are exclusive to you  people will tune in to your channel just to see it first   than if you say   our show is really good but your audience has already seen the best bits on youtube   mostly because of copyright and broadcasting rights  say you are in the uk and want to watch an hbo show  hbo s agreement with  say bbc  might require that they not allow uk viewers to stream their show because bbc wants to get more paying viewers  hbo is then forced to forward these terms to hulu  netflix  youtube  etc as part of those sites being able to show that hbo show  in rare cases  like iran   there may be an actual embargo in place that legally limits what can be  exported   downloads are actually considered a type of export in those cases  i ll trade you hulu for internet poker  deal ,0
there are several reasons why terrorists have not used nuclear weapons first acquiring a nuclear weapon is very difficult and expensive it requires a lot of resources and expertise to build a nuclear weapon and most terrorists do not have access to these resources second most countries have laws and international agreements in place to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons for example the nuclear nonproliferation treaty is an international agreement that aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and encourage the peaceful use of nuclear technology many countries have signed this treaty which makes it difficult for terrorists to get their hands on nuclear weapons finally even if a terrorist group were able to get a nuclear weapon it would be very hard for them to use it without getting caught most countries have systems in place to detect and prevent the use of nuclear weapons such as satellites and other surveillance technologies overall while it is important to be vigilant and take steps to prevent terrorism the likelihood of terrorists using nuclear weapons is low due to the various obstacles in their way,1
its generally a good idea to try to put down a down payment when you are buying a home as it can help you secure a lower mortgage rate and can also reduce the amount you need to borrow however there are some circumstances where it may be possible to buy a home with no down paymentone option is to look for a mortgage program that allows for a zero down payment some examples of these programs include va loans which are available to military service members and their families and usda loans which are available to buyers in certain rural areas these loans typically have more lenient credit requirements and may not require private mortgage insurance pmi which can add to the cost of your monthly paymentsanother option is to look for a home that is being sold by the owner who may be willing to offer financing directly to the buyer this is known as a sellerfinanced sale and it can allow you to buy a home with no down payment however sellerfinanced sales can be risky as the seller may not have the same level of financial stability as a bank or mortgage lender and you may not have the same level of protection if something goes wrong with the transactionultimately the decision to rent or buy a home with no down payment will depend on your financial situation and your longterm goals its a good idea to carefully consider all of your options and seek the advice of a financial professional before making a decision,1

a ouija board is a flat board marked with the letters of the alphabet the numbers 0 through 9 the words yes no and goodbye and various other symbols and words people often use a ouija board as a way to try to communicate with the spirits of deceased peoplernrnto use a ouija board people usually sit around the board with their fingers lightly resting on a small heartshaped piece of wood or plastic called a planchette they then ask the board questions and wait for the planchette to move spelling out answers by sliding over the letters and numbers on the boardrnrnthere is no scientific evidence that the ouija board can be used to communicate with spirits and many people believe that the movements of the planchette are simply the result of the users unconsciously moving it themselves this is known as the ideomotor effect which is the phenomenon of people unconsciously moving their muscles in response to certain suggestions or ideas so while using a ouija board with trustworthy people may be a fun or interesting activity it is not a reliable way to communicate with the spirits of deceased individuals,1
a 35 mm film frame can be scanned to anywhere between 3 and 12 million pixels  depending on the stock  lens  and shooting conditions  an hd frame has 2 million pixels  measured using 1920 x 1080 scan lines  that s the simple explanation   here s the detail if you want it   url0   the big screens in movie theaters typically had a  higher resolution  than home televisions  this is a bit of a simplification   and so the originals for the film would be a  higher resolution  than what would be encoded on vhs or dvds  now that hd tvs are popular in the home  studios can re  release the same movies onto formats which support higher resolution  such a bluray  using those same originals  revealing detail that was nt visible from the vhs or dvd versions  hd refers only to resolution  number of horizontal pixels  x  number of vertical pixels   film has a certain degree of sharpness based on the quality of the film stock  the blank film it was recorded on  and the size of the film stock  35 mm is common  although it is expensive to film with  so sometimes 16 mm or 8 mm is used   imax is 65 mm  much larger  which is why it has a better  resolution   or sharpness  that can be seen when the film is shown on a larger screen  film does not have a set resolution  it is limited only by the imperfections of the recording equipment and the quality and size of the film stock  think of it as a painters canvas  if you use a large canvas  you can put more detail  sharpness  into the picture  but if your canvas is small  it will most likely be less detailed ,0
what it basically does is put small layers of plastic  or whatever  they have different kinds of 3d printers  on top of eachother  your printer at home works in lines  it prints a line  moves the paper a tiny but and then prints the next line  3d printers move in 3 dimensions  and instead of lines they do layers   here s a video   url0  from wikipedia  seeing it in action explains a lot  i ll try a more eli5 answer  there are two types of 3d printers i am aware of  both start with a computer model  like a character in a video game it is a 3d picture of what the final product should look like  it then cuts that model into thin little sheets or layers  starting at the bottom and working its way up  the more common type uses a nozzle and a tank filled with plastic  kind of like the frosting bag that you use to decorate cakes  it spits out plastic  one layer at a time and then moves upwards a little bit and spits out the next layer of plastic  this way it  draws  the thing you are printing  one layer at a time until it reaches the top and it is done  the other type uses a powder that gets hard when it gets hot  a special laser shoots down into the powder and gets hot at just the right depth  this kind does the same thing as the other one  drawing the 3d object  one thin layer at a time  but with lasers instead of plastic  once it is done  you can reach into the powder  and pull out the thing you printed   here is a neat video of that kind of 3d printer   url0  basically a 3d model is created on the computer and then saved into a specific file format on a storage device  eg usb   this data is then transferred to the 3d printer and converted into commands for the 3d printer to follow  the printer has a supply of material  most likely a thermoplastic  a plastic that melts easily and well  such as polymer  lego is an abs polymer   the material is ejected from the nozzle and melted  the printer starts at the very bottom of the design and prints every single layer individually  the printer nozzel moves up after that layer and starts the next layer  it repeats this until it is finished ,0
its not accurate to say that the number of people with adhd has increased by 10 times in the past 10 years while it is true that the number of people diagnosed with adhd has increased over time it is not accurate to say that it has increased by such a large amount there are several reasons why the number of people diagnosed with adhd may have increased over time one reason may be that there is now more awareness about adhd and the symptoms associated with it as a result more people are seeking treatment and receiving a diagnosis another reason may be that there are more effective treatments available now than in the past which may make it easier for people with adhd to manage their symptoms and lead productive lives finally it is also possible that the criteria for diagnosing adhd have changed over time which may have led to more people being diagnosed with the condition,1
when there is an oil spill it can be tempting to try to burn the oil because it might seem like an easy way to get rid of the oil and the mess it causes however there are a few reasons why burning the oil is not a good solution n1 burning the oil creates air pollution when the oil is burned it releases harmful chemicals into the air these chemicals can be harmful to people animals and the environment n2 burning the oil can spread the spill when the oil is burned the fire can cause the oil to spread to other areas which can make the problem even worse n3 burning the oil can cause damage to the environment the heat from the fire can damage plants and animals in the area and the smoke from the fire can also harm these living things ninstead of burning the oil it is usually better to try to clean up the spill and remove the oil from the environment this can be done in a number of ways such as using special chemicals to break down the oil using booms to contain the oil and using absorbent materials to soak up the oil cleaning up an oil spill is a big deal because it is important to protect the environment and the living things that depend on it,1
these sort of issues in structuring your personal finances relative to expenses can get complicated quickly as your example demonstrates  i would recommend a solution that reduces duplication as much as possible and depending on what information youre interested in tracking you could set it up in very different ways one solution would be to create virtual sub accounts of your assets and to record the source of money rather than the destination  thus when you do an expense report you can limit on the his or hers asset accounts and see only the expenses which pertain to those accounts likewise for liabilitiescredit cards if on the other hand youre more interested in a running sum of expenses rather than create me and spouse accounts at every leaf of the expense tree it would make much more sense to create top level accounts for expenseshisetc and expenseshersetc  using this model you could create only the sub expense accounts that apply for each of your spending with matching account structures for common accounts,0
it was nt a single large action it was a serious of smaller actions that on their own fostered no opposition  first it would be something innocuous like having jews register with the government  then something a little farther but not necessarily frighting like forcing jews to wear a star signifying that they where jewish  then you come in and say that the jews are causing the housing market to fail so you prevent anyone registered as a jew from buying property  but you also set up cities for them to live in  then you step up police action around the new formed ghettos to frame them as lawless  slowly but surely you foster the idea the jews are outsiders that do nt belong with the german populace  the popular narrative is that they were acting like a bunch of monsters rubbing their hands thinking about evil schemes against the jews  but the actual historical fact if you read contemporary accounts and newspapers etc is that they were entirely convinced in their head that they are on the side of justice and are fighting to make the world a better place  the subjective psychological situation is basically indistinguishable from how eg it felt to a typical american when the us invaded iraq  there are no such thing as self  consciously unjust wars  hitler s political philosophy was based in an explicit opposition to certain groups  especially jews and communists  supporting hitler required continuously reaffirming your opposition to those groups  when he was appointed chancellor  he quickly worked to eliminate opposition and put sole control in the hands of the nazi party  you could be secretly arrested and killed on suspicion of not supporting the regime  so in that climate  it was hard to be too skeptical of anything the german government did  there was a gradually increasing persecution of jews  political dissidents and others  the safest thing to do was to go along with it without asking questions  ordinary germans could try to reason that the people being arrested had done something to deserve it  it was easy to believe  or at least convenient to try to believe  the nazi narratives of jewish conspiracies and exploitation of germany  when the government started planning genocide  which did nt really start until 1941  when the nazis had been in power for 8 years   it was kept secret  many of the camps were located in poland rather than in the heart of germany  euphemisms were used for everything  if you were  deported  to a camp  nobody heard from you again  some were labor camps where people died because conditions were poor  but others were death camps were the arrivals were exterminated  although ordinary people had a sense of what was being done  most of them did not have to actively confront it in their day  to  day lives  even if you had neighbors who were arrested  or you worked for the police  or you kept the trains running  you never really  knew   and the circumstances certainly encouraged ignoring what you had every reason to infer  so most of germany tacitly acquiesced  in short  the holocaust did nt come from nowhere  but exploited existing prejudices  the nazi state was designed in a way that minimized political dissent and made critical thinking dangerous  there was a gradual shift from persecution to extermination  and despite being on such a large scale  the actual operation of the holocaust was shrouded in euphemisms and secrecy ,0
no bar soap is not selfcleaning bar soap is a cleaning agent that is used to remove dirt oil and germs from your skin when you wash your hands or take a shower it works by creating a lather with water that helps to lift the dirt and germs off your skin and then rinsing them away with the water however the soap itself does not become clean in the process it is important to store your soap in a dry place and to keep it away from germs and bacteria when you are not using it this will help to keep it clean and effective for as long as possible,1
bubbles in soda are caused by dissolved co2 gas  carbon dioxide  which are escaping the liquid  soda  water can only hold so much co2  and when it holds as much co2 as it can  it is called a saturated solution  you can increase the capacity of a liquid to hold gas or other solutes by increasing the temperature of the solution  the opposite is also true  when you decrease the temperature  you decrease the solution s ability to hold the solute  adding cold ice lowers the temperature of the soda  especially the area right around the ice  which in turn lowers the ability of the water to hold the co2  the co2  bubbles  suddenly escape the solution  causing fizz to form  for a still liquid it s actually pretty tough for a bubble to form on its own  there is surface tension between the bubble and the liquid  and for a small bubble the tension is very large relative to its size  the ice will contain crevices that provide a place where bubbles can form  because there will be a smaller bubble   liquid surface   the technical term for this is called a   nucleation site   url0    this is the same effect as putting mentos into diet coke  it s a mix of the ice agitating the liquid  causing the co2 to prematurely release from the soda  and that the instant cold liquid disrupts the liquid again causing premature gas release  carbon monoxide is  weakly soluble in water  meaning it separates from the liquid rather easily ,0
dogs and cats have a different immune system than humans which makes them less susceptible to some diseases that can be transmitted through feces however its important to note that even though dogs and cats may be less likely to get sick from licking their own butt its still not a good idea for them to do it licking their butt can cause them to ingest harmful bacteria and parasites which can lead to other health problems nas for humans we can get sick from ingesting feces because it can contain harmful bacteria viruses and parasites that can cause serious illnesses when feces gets into the water supply it can contaminate the water and make people who drink the water sick this is especially true in areas where there isnt a good system in place to treat the water and make it safe to drink nits important for humans to practice good hygiene and to make sure that our water is clean and safe to drink this means washing our hands regularly and using clean safe water to brush our teeth cook our food and drink,1
the reserve bank of australia rba is the central bank of australia and is responsible for setting the official interest rate also known as the cash rate the rba uses this tool to influence the supply and demand of credit in the economy with the aim of achieving its monetary policy objectivesin setting the cash rate the rba considers a range of economic factors including inflation employment and economic growth it does not specifically consider house prices when making its decisions on interest rates however changes in the cash rate can have an impact on the housing market as it can affect the cost of borrowing and in turn the demand for housing for example if the cash rate is increased it may make it more expensive for people to borrow money to buy a house which could lead to a decrease in demand for housing and potentially put downward pressure on house prices,1
no offense  but your doctors there to field such questions  your health matters  ask every question you can ask your doctor  it takes time to build up body levels of the active ingredients in your drugs  azathioprine  aza  works by interfering with dna synthesis  basically the molecule kind of looks like a dna base  so your cells try to use it to construct dna  when they do this aza gets stuck in the cellular machinery and the whole process comes to a halt  aza does this to your white blood cells and prevents them from dividing  reducing their number and thus their ability to cause autoimmune damage  so  why does this take so much time before you see the effect  all of the white blood cells in your body come from stem cells  and the process of development from stem cell to fully functional white blood cell  called hematopoesis  takes some time  aza prevents these cells replication  but does not do much to prevent their maturation  because of this  once you start taking aza creates a  wave  of reduced white blood cells that you do nt see until all of the cells that had already divided finish maturing  imagine if everyone in the world stopped getting pregnant today  you would probably still see babies being born tomorrow  and the next day  and the day after that  in fact  you would not notice any change in the birth rate until 9 months from now  when all of the babies who had already been conceived were born  aza is kinda doing the same thing to your immune system  there are a bunch of reasons  one  drugs have a half life  that is that after so many hours  only half the drug is in your system  it wears off   they also have a certain therapeutic range  that is too much and it makes your sick  not enough it does nt do anything  so a drug might need 5  10 mg in your system at all times to always work  if the half life is 12 hours then they can prescribe 5mg  twice per day  however with this it does nt really start working until the second dose  because you take your first pill and get 5 mg in your system and it drops below the therapeutic range instantly and does nt  work  for the next 12 hours  by which time you have 25 mg in your system  take the next dose and you get 75 mg in your system and it starts working  but after a few hours it s back below 5 mg  in the long run a 5mg  day dose will keep you in the 5  10 mg range  but it takes a while to build up to that  and during that time it s either not working  or working for only a few hours between doses  sometimes doctors will tell you to take a double dose on the first day to overcome this  it s especially important with drugs that have very long half lives and a narrow therapeutic range  they have to subscribe tiny doses for the long run and it may not be enough on the first week  second  many drugs do start working instantly  but the way they work means it greatly delays the response  antibiotics frequently work by killing bacteria when they split  during budding or something like that   the thing is if you take it  it might have enough in your system  but the bacteria might only split every 12 hours  so those first 6  12 hours  most of the bacteria are actually alive and healthy  it s not until they attempt to grow that they get killed  and with that  you re feeling sick  not because of the bacteria  but because of your bodies immune response to them and maybe the damage they did to you  killing bacteria actually releases them into your blood which can make the immune response stronger  it s not until the bacteria are gone that your body dials back it s response  and even then you have damage that needs to heal  so things may still be sore even after it s all clear  and to combine these points  many drugs act on your body slowly  so as to not shock or stress you  you might take a drug to suppress your immune system  but it actually suppresses it maybe 1  from where it was yesterday  and maybe it ca nt do more because it acts on something that only allows that much change  you thus have to take it over long periods of time  to slowly change your body ,0

quarks are tiny particles that make up protons and neutrons which in turn make up the nucleus of an atom atoms are the basic building blocks of matter and everything in the world is made up of atoms quarks are so small that its hard to imagine how tiny they are to give you an idea if a single quark were blown up to the size of a sugar cube an atom would be about the size of the earth quarks are held together by a force called the strong nuclear force which is one of the four fundamental forces of nature the others being the weak nuclear force electromagnetism and gravity scientists believe that quarks are the smallest things in the universe and that they cant be broken down into anything smaller,1

i m not exactly sure how to explain pdd  nos  other than similar to autism  but there can be major differences  i ve worked with children and adults with special needs for quite a while and i just want to offer some support by saying give your child your all  it will help him  her immensely  it s hard to stick by routines set up by teachers  therapists but it will pay off  it sucks being rigid at first  but the more on  board with consistency you are  the better your little one will respond  it takes time  be patient  be willing  be strong  love your little one  find the good in everything he  she does that fits what you re working toward  keep fighting for him  her  if someone tells you no  go somewhere else  find out what your state  county can give you or help you with  communicate with other families  the squeaky wheel gets the oil  so if you feel like you need help  squeak away   in regard to school districts or counties  i m an independent provider for my state meaning i am paid by medicaid to provide services to families on state  funded waivers  services are out there so you re not flying solo  i m sorry if this was long  i hope something helped  good luck and never stop fighting for the best for your kiddo  you re all they have  i was diagnosed when i was about 12  so i can try to give a basic gist of my symptoms  though i do sometimes question my diagnosis  my case is most likely a result of a brain disorder i have called tuberous sclerosis  i was pretty fine as a little boy  though starting sometime early on  whenever i would get excited  i would flap my hands around at my ears  no matter where i was  in public this eventually died out when i was about 8  10 years old  in private  if i listen to a song i really like or get caught up in a thought  i ll still find myself flapping my hands  though only if i m subconsciously sure that there s nobody around  i ve been pretty high  functioning  with grades never being an issue  and i m able to think pretty logically and laterally to solve a problem  on many websites listing the symptoms of pdd  nos  they differentiate it from asperger s by saying that pdd  nos usually has some sort of language delay  though i believe i acquired language skills just fine  i did fine making friends and all that in elementary school  although i ve always been a more laid  back person  when puberty hit  my social skills sorta went away  starting sometime in 7th grade it became very hard for me to approach people  and i have nt really recovered from that yet  i m 18 now   if it s a planned appointment or something  i m fine  but if i m suddenly approached  i ll be at a sort of loss for words and have trouble with body language and stuff  and i often overthink what people may think of me  another key sign of pdd  nos is a difficulty adapting to a change in routine and environment  though i do nt really have a routine i live by and i do enjoy getting out and going new places  hopefully that helps a little  even though i made it a lot about myself  i know a lot of people sort of become a master of knowledge of a disease or something if they discover they have it  but i really only know how it s affected me  like i said in the beginning  if i do have it  i imagine it might be very lightly  as i have seen multiple therapists about it  and have gotten a bunch of different opinions  though the whole hand  flapping thing would suggest some sort of autistic trace i think  i hope the best for your child  if you were specifically asking for what steps you should take to help them  i m afraid i ca nt help very much as i m no psychologist  but as anyone would say  hang in there and do nt give up  there is a lot to say about this issue that is very difficult to summarize and unfortunately i am unable to eli5  however  i can draw from experience  we have been dealing with a pdd  nos diagnosis for 7 years now and the more i speak to professionals the more i see it as a blanket diagnosis for what is poorly understood  that being said  it is your responsibility to be an advocate for your child  be persistent and stay positive  like any child he  she will learn from experience so push them to participate in as many activities as you can early on  there are many resources available  respite  support groups  counselling   but not all are easy to find so keep looking for more  generally the agencies that are there to help will go out of their way to do so if you show a genuine interest in the welfare of your child  if you have gotten a diagnosis by 3 years old you are a great parent and definitely have the resources available  just remember to take time for yourselves too ,0
it is generally not legal to pay a loan under someone elses name without their knowledge and consent this is because loans involve a legal agreement between the lender and the borrower and only the borrower is responsible for repaying the loan paying a loan under someone elses name without their knowledge or consent could be considered fraud which is a criminal offenseadditionally borrowing money under false pretenses is not only unethical but it could also have serious consequences for the person whose name is being used for example if the loan is not repaid the lender may try to collect the debt from the person whose name was used even if they had nothing to do with the loan this could damage their credit and financial reputationif you are facing financial difficulty and are considering borrowing money it is important to be honest and upfront about your circumstances there may be options available to help you manage your debt such as negotiating with your lender for more favorable terms or seeking the assistance of a financial advisor or credit counselor it is always better to explore legal and ethical options for managing your debts rather than resorting to fraudulent or deceptive practices,1
there are many factors that can contribute to the prevalence of certain last names one reason that some last names may be more common is because they originated in areas with larger populations for example last names that originated in countries with large populations such as china or india may be more common globally because there are more people with those namesnnanother reason that some last names may be more common is because they were adopted by a larger number of people in the past for example certain last names may have been adopted by a large number of people who converted to a particular religion or who lived in a certain region and adopted the local last namennadditionally some last names may be more common simply because they are easier to pronounce or spell which could make them more appealing to people who are choosing a last name for themselves or their childrennnoverall the prevalence of certain last names can be influenced by a variety of factors including population size cultural and historical factors and ease of pronunciation and spelling,1
why do you need this explained to you like you re 5 years old  yet again this sounds like an ask reddit question  from what i understand  starcraft came out in a time were internet cafe were booming  people were expressing them self online as the rest of the world around them was trying to conform  gaming grew mainstream through outlets of starcraft and a super popular korean mmo that is escaping me right now  china also has a huge esports following and love for starcraft  and with mlg and starcraft 2 the esports love in the us has grown exponentially over the last year  korea will always be the mecca and birthplace of serious completive gaming  they were the first place to do it on a large scale  after the video game crash of 1983  japanese companies nintendo  sega  and sony took a massive stranglehold over the console video game industry that would nt be broken until microsoft released the xbox in 2001  the japanese are a bit racist against koreans  and as such  console gaming was not really an option for koreans  therefore  pc gaming took off  and games like starcraft  warcraft  and counterstrike became really popular  as to why starcraft has remained popular  its infectiously fun to watch  addicting to play  and requires extremely high levels of skill and concentration to be good at  in this respect  its like every other pro sport  except that it is played on a computer  of course  there are other reasons  but this is one of the major ones ,0
in a vacuum  all things fall at the same rate of speed  in the stratosphere he was in  the lack of pressure essentially put him in a vacuum  for the first 30 seconds he was falling extremely fast  over 700 mph  because the distance of the  vacuum  allowed such speed to be gained  you ll notice after about 30 seconds he eventually was nt doing a death tumble but gained control over his falling  he gradually exited the  vacuum  into pressurized area  which slowed him down and gave him control  air is made up of a bunch of molecules  when you hit these molecules  they slow you down  when you re at 120000  feet  there is a lot less air  hence a lot less molecules for you to hit  terminal velocity is caused by air resistance  cancelling out acceleration due to gravity  if earth did nt have an atmosphere  he would keep accelerating until he hit the ground  so he broke the barrier in the vacuum  i suppose there s no sonic boom in a vacuum ,0
yawning is a natural reflex that occurs when we inhale deeply and exhale slowly it is often associated with tiredness or boredom but it can also be triggered by other factors such as changes in temperature or altitude or even by seeing someone else yawnrnrnthe act of yawning is thought to help increase blood flow and oxygen to the brain and it may also help to regulate brain temperature when we see someone else yawn it can trigger a reflex in our own brain that causes us to yawn as well this is known as contagious yawningrnrncontagious yawning is a common phenomenon that has been observed in humans and many other animals it is not fully understood why we yawn contagiously but some research suggests that it may be a way for our brains to sync up with the people around us it may also be a way for our brains to signal that we are alert and ready to pay attentionrnrnso to summarize yawning is a natural reflex that helps to increase blood flow and oxygen to the brain and we might yawn after seeing someone else yawn because our brains are trying to sync up with the people around us,1

the dalai lama is the traditional head of the government of the region  country of tibet  china declares itself to control and own tibet as a part of china  although affording it regional autonomy  the dalai lama on the other hand refuses any official chinese title and rejects china s control of the area  declaring tibet as an independent country  china of course does nt enjoy this sort of rebellion and generally sees the dalai lama as a criminal  the dalai lama is tibeten  tibet is controlled by china and their freedom and sovereignty is a very pressing political question for tibetens and for the dalai lama  more importantly the dalai lama is a very important religious and human rights leader who has met with pretty much every world leader and many other important people spreading the importance of peace and respect as well as the struggles of people in asia and specifically tibet  so for china it s very inconvenient that a hugely important and respected figure goes around the world talking about the unpleasant things the chinese government does  china is  huge   and tibet is not the only region where some people have separatist ambitions  not by a long shot  so the prc s leadership is absolutely terrified of any of them gaining any shred of legitimacy and encouraging the others  because that might start a chain reaction and tear apart the country in a civil war that would cost many millions of lives ,0
the electoral college helps to give states the representation that they would not normally have  also if there was no electoral college  instead of campaigning across the country  presidential candidates would just focus on heavily populated cities to gain votes  also  you can vote for your states electors so you can try to make sure he or she properly votes for your preferences  the electoral college is very relevant  and your vote does matter  it is relevant once again  for the reason that is gives states proper representation and it prevents candidates from abusing popular vote  with the whole  why should i vote   question  many electoral college members vote based on the popular vote of the state  some states even divide their votes and give portions to the candidates based on the popular vote ratio  the electoral college has worked fairly well for the past 200 years  except for two occasions  that was in the 1824 and 2000 elections  where the candidate with the lower popular vote won  so it has a pretty good track record  the electoral college was invented as a compromise for the smaller states who would just get crushed in a popular vote  it is still effective for that purpose  the thing you have to remember about this issue is that there are semi  independent states in our country  50 of them  this is   key   because funding goes out to the states themselves and not directly to the people  think about it this way  you could make a lot of people happy in a hurry if you promised the most populated states more money than the rest   yes they could do that now  but the electoral college helps prevent this exact thing   if it was a popular vote huge swaths of the country would have almost no say in electing a president  all the money would go to urban development  mass transit  and city parks   not too much of an exaggeration  really   smaller states have a bigger say in the election of the president than is proportional to their population  i figured in nd their vote is worth about 4 times a californian s vote  that s because they get the 2 senators on top of their  1  electoral college rep  this is a way of mitigating the power that highly populated staes already have   you guys have the house to begin with   i live in nd and have never once had our state support the candidate i voted for  i still support the electoral college becasue although we have to decide together  once we decide we can bring more force to bear  in essence  we are greater than the sum of our parts with the electoral college  because most people do nt know or think about the system and thus do nt call for its removal  on top of that it is not a hot button issue  its not abortion or gay marriage so the politicians will most likely never pay attention to it ,0
when people sing they usually try to speak with a clear and even tone which can make their accent less noticeable this is because singing involves producing a melody and having a strong accent can sometimes make it harder to pronounce the words in the song clearly on the other hand when people are speaking normally they might not be paying as much attention to how clearly they are speaking and their accent might be more noticeable as a result does that make sense,1
at least in my country they cantmeaning they are nt allowed to without a warrant signed by a judge   but lets assume you are in a country where none of this laws are in place  when doing something on the internet every bit of data you send or receive goes through your isp  so they can see everything  but how do they find traffic that s potentially illegal  there are several ways  one is to look at the port on the other site  if its not a common port of a server you probably have p2p traffic  this might mean that you are using torrents or some other kind of filesharing tool  some providers went overprotective and disabled such connection completely  this caused issues because not all traffic in this ranges is p2peg  cs  s  tf2 servers   not all p2p traffic is torrents and not all torrents are illegal  another way is to get a list of domains that contain potiental illegal contentoneclick hoster  torrents  warez   if the user uses the dns  server of the isp almost everytime he wants to reach a website he will have to send a request to his isp asking them to give them the ip  adress to this site  if the requested site is on the list they can take a note and mark the user for suspicious behaviour  but if the user uses another dns  server the isp can look into the data send  if its an unencrypted request the target adress will be readble  even if its encrypted  the target ip  adress must be contained and using this one can get a list of sites  if one of the sites is on the blacklist the user can be marked for suspicious behaviour  if the user causes much traffic something might eb off too  he might just be playing video games  hosting a gaming server or he uses torrents  if a user is to suspicious the isp can then go and look deeper into what he is doing  what files he dowloaded or uploaded unencrypted and if one of the files is copyrighted material he done goofed  imagine the internet are cars on a freeway  web traffic   from 2 pm to 6 pm there are 1000 cars per hour that pass along a checkpoint with a few highway patrol to make sure people are behaving  traffic cameras are monitoring all these cars on a normal monday afternoon  isp watching   nothing unusual  all of a sudden there are 80000 cars per hour traveling and the isp starts getting scared and suspicious at all this traffic their cameras are capturing  they start looking more closely  it s an illegal race    if you only download 20 mb of data per day  but then download 1 gb of data the following days  the isp can trace where it s coming from and what it is unless you encrypt your web traffic  if a red car goes in a tunnel  but a blue  green  and yellow car come out of the tunnel  there s really no way to tell what happened  same thing with a vpn  the isp sees you re online  but ca nt tell what s going on  isps for the most part only respond to 3rd party complaints or if your connection is causing technical issues to their network  using a vpn or peerblock can prevent a ton of hassle for you and them  it s also dependent on the torrent itself  if you download a free linux distro dvd via torrent or something public domain they ca nt do anything ,0
the reason that they allow you to do it is because sometimes it is fundamentally necessary to delete  change  or add files to system32 in order to fix bugs in the system or upgrade things  the user either has access to the files or does nt have access to the files  if they have access to the files  they can do what they want with them  including deleting them  if you create an account that is nt an administrator account you wo nt be able to delete system32  or many other important things  you also ca nt install programs  windows has a very extensive permissions system and you can tune the permissions to change what certain users can and can not do  ideally  you should be running as a non  administrator all the time  and then only switch into the admin account when you actually need to do something that requires the extra permissions  they re files  files can get deleted  normally  system files like that are going to be hidden  protected  flagged as system files so you ca nt just click  delete  but if you want to do something fundamentally stupid  you re free to do it  because in windows  most users are logged in with administrative privileges  when you are an administrator  you re allowed to do almost whatever you want  for whatever reason  because administrators are supposed to know what they re doing  in fact  the administrator user in windows is actually  more  restrictive than the equivalent in linux  some files ca nt be touched even as an administrator in windows  while in linux  the  root  user can literally delete any file at any time  even if the file is currently in use  the entire os can be deleted while the os is in use if you re root  ideally  you should nt be logged in as an admin all the time in windows  but that has unfortunately become the norm for home computers  normal users are nt allowed to touch anything that are nt their own files  and are denied access to critical system files ,0
the moon has a strong effect on the tides on earth because of its gravitational pull the gravitational force of the moon pulls on the earths oceans causing the water to be attracted to the moon this creates high tides on the side of the earth closest to the moon and low tides on the side farther away from the moon the tides are also affected by the gravitational pull of the sun but the moon has a much stronger effect because it is closer to the earthrnrnthe tides have a big impact on the earth because they affect the movement of the oceans which are a major part of the earths climate and weather the tides also play a role in the ecosystems of the oceans influencing the behavior and movements of marine animals and plantsrnrnto understand this better imagine the earth as a ball with a big bowl of water sitting on top of it when the moon is on one side of the earth its gravitational pull causes the water in the bowl to be pulled towards the moon creating a high tide when the moon is on the other side of the earth the water is not being pulled towards the moon as much so there is a low tide the moons gravitational pull causes the water to constantly be moving creating high and low tides twice a day,1

different internet browsers perform differently because they use different underlying technology and have different features some people may prefer one browser over another because it has features that they like or because it works better on their particular device or operating system as for internet explorer it was once a very popular browser but it has not been updated as frequently as some other browsers so it may not have as many new features or work as well on some newer websites,1

are there banks where you can open a bank account without being a citizen of that country without having to visit the bank in person ive done it the other way around opened a bank account in the uk so i have a way to store gbp  given that britain is still in the eu you can basically open an account anywhere  german online banks for instance allow you to administrate anything online should there be cards issued you would need an address in the country  and for opening an account a passport is sufficient you can identify yourself in a video chat  now whats the downside  french banks online services are in french german banks services are in german  if that doesnt put you off i would name such banks in the comments if asked are there any online services for investing money that arent tied to any particular country can you clarify that  you should at least be able to buy into any european or american stock through your broker  that should give you an ease of mind being fcaregulated  however those are usually gdrs global depository receipts and denominated in gbp pence so youd be visually exposed to currency rates by which i mean that if the stock goes up 1 but the gbp goes up 1 in the same period then your gdr would show a 0 profit on that day also and more annoyingly dividends are distributed in the foreign currency then exchanged by the issuer of the gdr on that day and booked into your account so if you want to be in full control of the cashflows you should get a trading account denominated in the currency and maybe situated in the country youre planning to invest in if youre really serious about it some brokersbanks offer multicurrency trading accounts again i will name them if asked where you can trade a wide range of instruments natively ie on the primary exchanges and you get to manage everything in one interface  those accounts typically include access to the foreign exchange markets so you can move cash between your accounts freely well for a surcharge  also typically each subaccount is issued its own iban,0

in artificial intelligence an expert system is a computer system emulating the decisionmaking ability of a human expertnexpert systems are designed to solve complex problems by reasoning through bodies of knowledge represented mainly as ifâ€“then rules rather than through conventional procedural code the first expert systems were created in the 1970s and then proliferated in the 1980s expert systems were among the first truly successful forms of artificial intelligence ai software nan expert system is divided into two subsystems the inference engine and the knowledge base the knowledge base represents facts and rules the inference engine applies the rules to the known facts to deduce new facts inference engines can also include explanation and debugging abilities,0

for a very long time  men were the ones going out of the house and doing stuff  work  errands  war  etc   while the woman stayed home and took care of the house and kids  it s pretty much a given that you re safer staying in the house all the time than you are going out into the world  thus  men would usually die earlier than women  nowadays  with the two genders slowly drifting towards equality  many women are out doing things and many men are staying home housekeeping  it s possible in a few generations that there will no longer be a clear consensus on which gender lives longer  while much of the gap is do to riskier behavior  there is evidence that   estrogen can be good for long term cardiovascular health  testosterone and excess iron can be bad for it  have an extra x chromosome can serve as backup for the genetic damage associated with aging however  those are just theories  no one is entirely sure yet  no one knows to a certainty why women tend to live longer than men  as evidenced by the fact that the vast  vast majority of living people over the age of 110 are women   but other factors contribute to the  statistical  discrepancy in the longevity of the sexes  even though they do nt tell us a whole lot  read  anything  about the biology behind longevity  for example  whether due to nature or culture  men are more likely to engage in  and die in  dangerous activities  dangerous jobs  men are often reluctant to seek medical attention until it s too late  more men than women serve in a combat capacity in militaries  etc  etc  but given the aforementioned discrepancy in the 110  group  i really do believe there is a biological tendency for female  born individuals to live longer  i just do nt know why ,0

controlling your bladder while you sleep is a skill that is learned over time usually during the first few years of life when you are a baby your body does not have the ability to control when you go to the bathroom as you grow older and become more aware of your bodys needs your brain learns to send signals to your bladder to hold onto urine until it is convenient for you to go to the bathroomrnrnas you continue to grow and mature your body becomes even better at controlling your bladder when you are asleep your brain is less aware of your bodys needs so it is possible that you might not wake up when you need to go to the bathroom however if your bladder becomes too full your body will automatically send a signal to your brain to wake you up so that you can go to the bathroom this is why it is important to try to use the bathroom before going to bed so that your bladder is not too full when you fall asleep,1
coming from a scientologist family myself  i will try to explain my understanding of the beliefs in a non  biased manner  i do not have a perfect grasp on it  as i do not practice it myself  i m agnostic  and my parents know you ca nt force something like religion on someone who does nt want it   i ll say this up front  i do not know it the xenu is true or not  i ve never heard the name xenu it mentioned in my house or any times i have been dragged along to the local mission  from my own viewpoint  it does nt seem to fit in with what i ve seen of the group  but it could be that it s kept for higher  ups  now  a quick disclaimer  i have never done any of the religious scientology courses  such as dianetics  i have  however  been shown the movie a couple of times in the past  so i will summarize the beliefs to my understanding  there may be information missing  or some things i have misunderstood  i do not represent scientology in any way  now  let s get onto it  i ll begin by explaining some terminology i know  scientologists believe in the thetan  which is comparable to a soul  it s the  essence  of the person  more or less the personality  from what i can gather   not having to do with the body or anything else physical  scientologists believe that the mind is split into two parts  the analytical mind  and the reactive mind  the analytical mind  as you might have guessed  is more or less conscious thought  it s what you would use to read this post  or do a simple mathematics problem  the reactive mind  however  is more along the lines of instinct and thoughts and feelings you do not have control over  an important thing to take note of is that they believe that the mind is always recording what is going on  even if one is unconscious   ironically  it s my observation that the idea of the reactive mind is almost identical to freud s theory of the unconscious mind  which most scientologists i know eschew   one thing you will hear about when talking about scientology are the dynamics  they are  urges towards survival  though many different mediums  the first dynamic  for example  is through yourself  cleaning yourself  feeding yourself and getting yourself better when you re sick are all examples of surviving through your first dynamic  these dynamics expand outwards from yourself  think of concentric circles  with the first dynamic at the heart   moving to survival through your family and reproduction  to survival though groups  such as your basketball team   to mankind as a whole  from there the dynamics begin to cover more broad areas  such as all living things  all physical matter  called mest  matter energy space and time   spirits  and the supreme being  or whatever you want to call it  also known as the infinity dynamic   now  it is scientology belief that people are all basically good  they want to do good acts and survive with their fellow beings along all eight dynamics  the reason this does nt happen  however  is because of aberrations in their nature called engrams  engrams are caused when some form of traumatic experience happens to a person  such as getting sick  getting hurt  or other such phenomenon  engrams can frequently be made when one becomes unconscious  engrams cause people to act in weird  irrational ways  for example  let s say a person became sick by eating a hard  boiled egg that had gone bad  from then on  he would have an engram stemming from that event  and become sick when confronted with another hard  boiled egg  whether or not he remembers that original sickness  this is where auditing comes in  now  i have never been audited  but i will do my best to explain what the end result is  the goal of auditing is to become  clear   or to get rid of all engrams from your current life  including ones that happened while you were in the womb  called pre  natal engrams  i have my own personal criticisms towards this theory  but i ll keep them in check  they are explained by your reactive mind recording the sounds and sensations outside the womb  which your mind can figure out when it becomes more developed    there are different courses in different areas after you become clear  but i know little of them  outside the fact that you eventually do auditing for engrams outside this life  i could tell a bit more about some nomenclature that they have  but i feel like that s a basic understanding of dianetics and their basic beliefs  i would be happy to tell about my own experiences with scientologists  and the study technology they use  as well as any other questions you may have  edit  tldr  basics of dianetics  auditing  and other beliefs that i ca nt explain in a tldr sentence  go read it if you want to be a bit more informed  lron hubbard was a mediocre science  fiction writer who got into a discussion with other writers about the gullibility of human beings  he bet them that he could invent a completely nonsensical religion  and get people to take to take it seriously  the result was scientology  initially  the whole thing was a con for the rubes  and he was role  playing  however  the rule of unintended consequences took over  and he came to believe what he was preaching  and then the whole scam took on a life of its own  you know next to nothing  you re over  qualified for scientology ,0
it s definitely still proper manners to stand up whenever someone arrives or leaves a table  have nt seen exactly the reason i was given  so i ll toss it in  when someone enters  leaves a room or the table  it s polite to greet then or wish them well  that s an awkward thing to do if you re seated and they re standing  especially in more formal situations where the greeting  farewell involves shaking hands or embracing  standing makes it less awkward by putting people at the same level  edit  typo side note  it is incorrect to stand for a lady if the table is at a buffet  as it would happen for all repeat trips to the food and draw attention to how much she is eating ,0
there are a few reasons why things might be more expensive at airports than they are in other places one reason is that airports are often located in a busy touristy area which means that the demand for goods and services is higher this means that businesses can charge more for their products because people are willing to pay more to get what they need while theyre traveling another reason is that airports are often crowded and busy places which means that businesses dont have to worry as much about attracting customers they can afford to charge more because they know that people will still come to them even if the prices are higher finally airports are often considered captive markets which means that people dont have as many other options for buying the things they need if youre stuck at an airport and you need to buy something you may be more likely to pay a higher price because you dont have many other choices overall the high prices at airports are often due to a combination of these factors,1
when you faint it means that you have temporarily lost consciousness this can happen for a number of reasons but it is usually due to a drop in blood pressure or a lack of oxygen reaching the brain when this happens your body may go limp and you may fall to the ground your brain activity may slow down and you may not be aware of what is happening around you you may also experience changes in your blood pressure and heart rate some people may dream while they are unconscious but it is not common for everyone,1
ping is a tool that is used to check if a computer or device is able to communicate with another computer or device over the internet imagine you are standing in one room and you want to know if someone is in the room next door one way to find out would be to knock on the door and wait for a response in the same way ping is like knocking on a virtual door to see if someone is there to use ping you enter a command into a computer or device and it sends a small packet of data called a ping to another computer or device if that other computer or device is able to receive the ping it will send a response back saying im here ping is often used to troubleshoot problems with internet connections or to test the speed of a connection for example if you are having trouble accessing a website you can use ping to see if there is a problem with your connection to the website or if the problem is with the website itself so in summary ping is a way to see if two computers or devices can communicate with each other over the internet,1
being hot they are evaporating fairly quickly  faster than cold liquids  the added surface area and energy from blending makes it evaporate even faster  causing air pressure to build until the lid pops off then blending liquids without a lid causes quite a mess  the trick is to take out the middle plug and hold the lid on with a towel if you had a blender with about a liter of boiling liquid that had just been placed in it  and the air above it was at room temperature  blending it would cause the air to heat rapidly because you re bringing the originally room temperature air in contact with the liquid and transferring heat to it  if you assume the air heats roughly to the same temp as the liquid  then the liter of air would suddenly want to occupy about 13 liters  since you have a lid on the blender  presumably   then it ends up raising the pressure by about 30   or about 45 pounds per square inch  if the lid had an area of about 9 square inches  that would be about 40 pounds of force   all calculations approximate  your mileage may vary depending on whether you are blending soup or something with less mass  mixed si and english units thrown in just to assure confusion  never seen it  but my guess is it causes cavitation  when liquid is hot  near it s boiling point  the pressure required to reach that boiling point is low  it s at zero at the boiling point   the blender blades create regions of lowered pressure  if the blades were fast enough you could do this to regular temperature water ,0
yes and no  your mind is built in software for the hardware of your brain  as the hardware expands the software gains complexity but accidents  and manufacturing defects  that harm the brain will limit the scope and ability of the mind to function optimally  the brain is the engine  the mind is the movement  you probably already know what the brain is  the mass of cells inside your skull  defining what  mind  is is kinda tricky  first of all  the metaphor of brain  mind as hardware  software is a deceptive one  most cognitive scientists will tell you to steer away from this type of thinking nowadays because it s way too simplistic and naive  and ultimately wrong  moreover  thinking of the mind as software and the brain as hardware hinders further research in both computer science and neuroscience  i can tell you more about this if you want to know  but i ll hint at it below  so what is the  mind   contemporary cognitive science  or the science that does study the mind and cognition  has quite a few followers who suggest that the mind is more than the brain   mind includes the body and how the person s body is   url1  and there are some who would say the  mind  is not just the brain in a body  but  also   a brain in a body in the world     url0   someone who has bipolar disorder does not have a  hardware malfunction   there is no  software  that can make a  hardware problem  better or go away  but  unlike the computer metaphor  the mind  can  make even the synaptic structures of the brain to change  today we do nt speak of nature vs nurture  but nature and nurture  our environment and how we interact with it does change our brain  albeit  to a certain extent   as a cognitive scientist myself  i would say the mind is not the software of the brain  hardware  the mind is that interaction between the brain  which is in a body which perceives the world in a certain way  and which is situated in a particular historical  cultural  social context ,0
investing can be a good way for people to potentially grow their wealth over time but it is important to keep in mind that investing carries some level of risk and it is not guaranteed to be a successful or profitable endeavorit is generally a good idea for people to consider their personal financial situation and goals before deciding whether or not to invest some things to consider may include your current income expenses debts and any other financial commitments you have it is also important to understand the level of risk you are comfortable with and the potential risks and rewards associated with different types of investmentsif you are in a position where you are struggling to make ends meet or have high levels of debt it may not be the best time to start investing in these situations it may be more important to focus on building a solid financial foundation by creating a budget reducing expenses and paying off debts once you are in a more stable financial position you may be in a better position to consider investingit is also important to note that becoming rich through investing is not a guarantee and it may take time and effort to grow your wealth through investing it is important to be patient and to have realistic expectations about the potential returns on your investments it is generally a good idea for everyone including those who are currently living in poverty to consider investing as a way to potentially increase their wealth over time investing in financial assets such as stocks bonds and mutual funds can help individuals build wealth by allowing their money to grow over time through compound interest however it is important to keep in mind that investing carries risk and there is no guarantee of a positive return on investment therefore it is important for individuals to carefully consider their financial situation and risk tolerance before making any investment decisionsadditionally there are other ways that individuals can increase their wealth and financial stability such as by improving their education and job skills finding ways to increase their income and budgeting and managing their finances effectively it is also important for individuals to consider seeking the guidance of a financial advisor or professional before making any investment decisions,1

those black cables that you see running across the road are called overhead power lines or overhead transmission lines they are used to transmit electricity from power plants to homes and businesses electricity is produced at a power plant and it is transmitted through these overhead power lines to substations the substations then distribute the electricity to homes and businesses through smaller power lines overhead power lines are usually made of aluminum or steel and are supported by tall poles or towers they are usually coated in black to protect them from the elements and to make them more visible to people and animals i hope this helps let me know if you have any other questions,1
photographs can sometimes look different from what we see in real life because of the way that cameras capture and record images when we see things with our eyes our brains automatically process and interpret the information to create a 3d image that we can understand cameras on the other hand record a 2d image which can sometimes look different from what we see in real lifernrnadditionally there are many factors that can affect how a person looks in a photograph such as lighting angles and the distance between the camera and the subject these can all contribute to why someone might look different in a photograph than they do in real lifernrnso to answer your question its not that i always look bad in photographs its just that photographs can sometimes not accurately represent what a person looks like in real life,1
el al like most airlines uses a dynamic currency exchange rate that is based on the current market exchange rate for the currencies involved in the transaction the exchange rate that el al uses for a particular transaction may be different from the exchange rate that is quoted by banks or currency exchange services as it is based on the rate that is available to el al at the time the transaction is processed it is not uncommon for exchange rates to fluctuate over time so the exchange rate that el al uses for a particular transaction may be different from the exchange rate that is used for other transactions even if they are completed around the same time,1
nafta or the north american free trade agreement is a trade agreement between the united states canada and mexico it was signed into law in 1993 and went into effect in 1994 the main goal of nafta was to reduce tariffs taxes on imported goods and other trade barriers between the three countries which would make it easier and cheaper for businesses to buy and sell goods and services across national borders this was supposed to help create new jobs and boost economic growth in all three countries there have been a lot of different opinions about the benefits and drawbacks of nafta some people believe that it has helped create new jobs and increased economic growth while others believe that it has led to the loss of jobs and harmed certain industries in all three countries despite these differing opinions nafta has not been repealed because it has been in place for a long time and many businesses and industries in the three countries have become reliant on it changing or repealing the agreement would be a major change that could have significant consequences for these businesses and industries so it is not something that is done lightly,1
url0 lots of math is very  very old  our numbering system uses a base of 10  but that s not the only option  computers use base 2  binary  and sometimes base 16  hexadecimal  for example  numbering systems can use any base at all  but the important thing is to be consistent  wayyyyyyyyyy back the babylonians used base 60  they divided each circle into 6  6  60360  as with any modern language there are sometimes odd hold overs from times past  in this case the world moved on to a base 10 system  but the whole 360 degrees in a circle was just never changed  changing it now would be a pain in the ass  but most more advanced math is done using radians anyway  so it does not really matter  360 can be evenly divided by more numbers  2  3  4  5  6  8  9  10  12  shoot  every number from 1 to 12 except 7 and 11  that s pretty convenient  while the true reason is nt known for sure  the wiki states a few theories  it could have been to match the number of days in a year in the persian calendar  or it could have been from babaloynians who used the number 60 frequently in their system  representing circle measurements with six equilateral triangles  each of which was broken down into sixty subdivisions  thus totalling 360  in any case  its continued popularity in ancient times may be in part due to how easily divisible it is by most small numbers ,0
cable stations often play the same movie twice in a row on weekends because it can be a good way to fill airtime and attract viewers some people might enjoy watching the same movie twice especially if it is a favorite movie or if they missed it the first time it was shown playing two movies with overlapping audiences might also be a good idea but it can be difficult to predict which movies will have the most appeal to viewers it is ultimately up to the cable stations to decide which movies to show and how to schedule them,1
squatters rights also known as adverse possession refer to a legal concept that allows a person to gain ownership of a piece of land by continuously occupying it for a certain period of time in california the laws governing adverse possession are set forth in the states code of civil procedurethe original intention of the law was to provide a way for people who had been occupying a piece of land for a long time often without the knowledge or permission of the true owner to gain legal ownership of the land this could happen if the true owner had abandoned the land or was unaware that someone else was living on it the idea was that if a person had been openly and continuously occupying a piece of land for a long period of time they should be able to claim it as their ownhowever some people have criticized the law arguing that it can be used to take advantage of people who have been living on a piece of land without realizing that they dont have a legal right to it in these cases the squatter may be able to claim ownership of the land even if the true owner has not abandoned it or given their permission for the squatter to be there some people believe that the law needs to be revised to better protect the rights of property owners,1
classes are generally divided into four broad categories   the  upper class   which does nt need to work for a living  nobles in old times  business owners  senior management  etc  in modern times  the lower levels of the upper class manage people  but they are nt  working   they re  managing   though since the 1960s  there are  middle managers   who are nt upper class    the  middle class   people who work for a living based on investments in themselves  high  skilled labor  small business owners  middle managers  who manage based on education  rather than based on connections   etc  historically  this was the  merchant class   occupied by wealthy merchants and guildmasters   the  working class   people who work for a living  often with their hands  but there s a lot of working class jobs that are based on college degrees now   the  poor   people who are nt making a living  either because they do nt work  or in more recent times  because the jobs  they have do nt pay the bills  the main difference is the experience of each class  the wealthy tend to be immune to even extreme economic failures  only drastic failures like the great depression cause them any problems  the working class  on the other hand  tend to be very depending on economic conditions  the middle class can weather normal economic disruption  and only runs into serious problems in larger or longer economic disruption  the dot  bomb was a minor setback for the middle class  but the recent credit crisis  mortgage bubble  recession did hit the middle class  a smaller middle class means that more people are economically vulnerable  meaning that smaller economic setbacks will be enough to cause large problems  this was nt an issue historically because there were nt as many poor  even people who were nt well off could at least take care of themselves  the middle class is a socioeconomic class between the wealthy and the working poor  there s no exact boundary because your standard of living can vary  but it s the group of people who are making enough money that they do nt have to live paycheck  to  paycheck just to keep up with their bills  but not so much that they re able to spend money on higher  class luxuries  there is nt a set definition that everyone uses  but it s usually based on standard of living  can you afford a new car  house  savings  insurance  vacations  etc   or the type of work people do  professionals and craftsmen vs clerical and low skill   you can define income  wealth ranges  but they re still usually based on living standards ,0
form 13f is a quarterly report that must be filed with the securities and exchange commission sec by investment advisors who manage at least 100 million in qualifying securities the form lists all of the securities that the investment advisor has held during the quarter including the name and ticker symbol of the security the number of shares or units held and the average or minimum price paid for the securityit is possible that the average and minimum price for a particular security listed on a form 13f are the same if the investment advisor only purchased that security at a single price during the quarter for example if an investment advisor purchased 1000 shares of a particular stock at a price of 50 per share the average price and the minimum price for that security would both be 50however it is also possible that the average and minimum price could be different if the investment advisor purchased the security at multiple prices during the quarter in this case the average price would be calculated by taking the total amount spent on the security and dividing it by the total number of shares purchased while the minimum price would be the lowest price paid for any individual purchase of the security,1

catalonia probably wo nt get recognized by the eu if it becomes independent  i think spain has a veto on new memberships  it s a very bad time to start your own country  particularly in the spanish region due to their economic problems  if the eu actually did recognize them  they d have the protection of other member states  germany and the uk have a real hard on for a country s sovereign rights  so spain would just have to accept it  nothing  spain wo nt recognise it  the eu wo nt recognise it  it s a non  binding referendum  it depends  if the countries will recognize the new entity as sovereign country or not  in current international law there are 2 distinct principles  right of nations to self  determination and the principle of territorial integrity  the territorial integrity is currently the preffered oneexcept for kosovo    if the people arenâ´t being opressed  killed etc  by the state  i think that people of catalonia arenâ´t being opressed enough because of their nationality  propably noone will recognize them as a state and they wonâ´t break away,0
a vapor is still matter  so are the people who were  vaporized  in the atomic blasts in japan  they were simply broken down into much smaller component parts  probably gas  ashes and dust  however  before they were vaporized  some of those poor people blocked the initial gamma ray burst and some part of the heat and debris of the blast  leaving a  shadow  of slightly less damage to the walls and sidewalks where they were at the time of the blast  again  not very much matter conversion and no matter destruction  the atomic bombs themselves  of course  very much do work on the principle of converting matter into energy  which is about as close to the  destruction  of matter as we can get  about 700 miligrams of the hiroshima bomb was converted into energy  that may not sound like much but the tragic results speak for themselves  vapor is still matter  look up in the sky  every cloud you see is water that s been vaporized  yet it has not been destroyed  it either goes through a chemical reaction whose products are a gas  or it gets pulverized into little bits that are scattered by the blast  or both ,0
when we close our eyes while kissing it can help us focus on the sensation of the kiss and the person were kissing it can also help us feel more relaxed and in the moment sometimes people close their eyes when theyre kissing because it feels more intimate and helps them feel more connected to the person theyre kissing so closing your eyes while kissing is a way to help you feel more present and connected to the person youre kissing does that make sense,1
its not hate  its a strong dislike of their racist policies  like giving african immigrants long term birth control without their knowledge  having a economic blockade on palestine  occupying palestine and kicking people out of there homes to let settlers live there  stuff like that  to give a simplified explanation israel was founded in the early  mid 20th century by british jews who wanted to reclaim their ancestral holy land and established a state with disregard for the predominantly muslim peoples who were there at the time  because of its founders  ties to the west  israel has always had close relations with the west  specifically  the usa  and is seen as somewhat of a puppet for the western agenda by the rest of the world  it also does nt help that israel tends to oppose the views of its neighbors on just about every political issue  further strengthening the argument that they will do whatever western powers tell them to do  it s a combination of poor policy decisions by israel  and centuries of anti  semitism,0
yes businesses are generally allowed to refuse to accept credit cards as a form of payment however if a business does accept credit cards it must follow the rules and regulations set by the credit card company such as not discriminating against certain types of cards or charging extra fees for using a credit cardin some cases businesses may choose not to accept credit cards because of the fees they must pay to the credit card company or because they prefer to accept other forms of payment however it is important for businesses to consider the preferences of their customers when deciding whether to accept credit cards many customers expect to be able to use credit cards as a form of payment and businesses that do not accept credit cards may risk losing business to competitors that do,1
i ve never seen a ghost before but so many people claimed they have  they all ca nt be lying  there s a difference between lying and thinking you saw something different than what you actually did  for all the supposed sightings  there has nt been any proof produced that they do exist  so chances are that they made a mistake   well  the ghost hunter shows are probably straight  up lying for the money and fame  but not everyone   but of course  create an entity who  by definition  can not be detected by the human senses nor measured by scientific instruments  we would never be able to prove if they exist or not  and thus the possibility that they  do  exists arises  the more important question is  does it make sense to believe in something you ca nt prove  it s pretty much impossible for ghosts to exist  or at the very least there are many  many questions that need to be answered  the most important question that needs to be answered is what are these ghosts made of  if they re made of atoms  what elements are they made of  and why are they invisible  and how do these atoms manage to organize themselves so that they can manipulate objects and have thoughts  and where do these atoms come from  you ca nt just create matter out of thin air  if they re not made of atoms  then they re made of something not currently known  which would mean a huge revelolution in basically all of science  once you figure that out  you have to wonder how humans go from being alive to being dead and ghosts  by what mechanism does this happen  ghosts generally have their body plus clothes  but their clothes are nt real clothes they re ghost clothes  how do these ghost clothes come about  what is it about dying that makes a person s clothes become ghost material  if they died with a phone would they have a ghost phone  would that ghost phone have service  i could go on for days  on the surface the idea of ghosts seems pretty simple  but when you dig into it the whole ghost process would have to be pretty complicated and operate in a way that our current knowledge says is impossible  so what s more likely  that all these people misinterpreted some noises and other things and exagerated a little bit when telling the story  or that there is a vast complex natural phenomenon that  when understood  would completely revolutionize our understanding of the world ,0
the equal pay act of 1963 is a federal law in the united states that requires employers to pay men and women equally for doing the same job it was passed in order to help reduce the gender pay gap which is the difference between the average wages of men and women the equal pay act has not completely eliminated the gender pay gap in the united states and there are still many factors that contribute to the gap one reason is that some employers may discriminate against women and pay them less than men for the same work this type of discrimination is illegal under the equal pay act but it can be difficult to prove and may still occur another reason for the gender pay gap is that women may be concentrated in lowerpaying occupations or industries for example women may be more likely to work in jobs that are traditionally seen as female roles such as teaching or nursing which tend to pay less than jobs that are traditionally seen as male roles such as engineering or finance there are also societal factors that contribute to the gender pay gap such as the fact that women may be more likely to take time off work to care for children or other family members which can affect their earning potential over the course of their careers overall the equal pay act has had some success in reducing the gender pay gap in the united states but it has not completely eliminated it there is still work to be done to ensure that men and women are paid equally for the same work,1
the main difference between the 32bit and 64bit versions of a program is the amount of memory that the program can access the 32bit version of a program can access up to 4gb of memory while the 64bit version can access more than 4gb of memorythe operating system os that you are using can also be a factor in whether you should use the 32bit or 64bit version of a program if you are using a 32bit version of the os then you will not be able to run the 64bit version of a program similarly if you are using a 64bit version of the os you will not be able to run the 32bit version of a programin general if you have a 64bit version of the os and a lot of memory 4gb or more you should use the 64bit version of the program this will allow the program to access more memory and potentially run faster if you have a 32bit version of the os or a limited amount of memory less than 4gb you should use the 32bit version of the programso to summarizethe 32bit version of a program can access up to 4gb of memorythe 64bit version of a program can access more than 4gb of memoryif you have a 64bit version of the os and a lot of memory use the 64bit version of the programif you have a 32bit version of the os or a limited amount of memory use the 32bit version of the program,1
theres no one reason why we eat certain foods at certain times of the day and peoples eating habits can vary greatly depending on their culture personal preferences and other factors however here are a few possible reasons why we might associate certain foods with particular mealsrnrntradition in many cultures certain foods have become traditional to eat at certain meals because they have been eaten that way for a long time for example in the united states it is common to eat eggs and cereal for breakfast because people have been doing it for generationsrnrnavailability some foods are more readily available at certain times of the day so they become associated with that meal for example it might be easier to find fruit in the morning because it is the start of the day so people might eat it for breakfastrnrnnutrition different foods provide different nutrients and it might be beneficial to eat certain foods at certain times of the day to get the nutrients we need for example it might be a good idea to eat a balanced breakfast that includes protein like eggs and carbohydrates like cereal to give us energy to start the dayrnrnconvenience sometimes we eat certain foods at certain times of the day because it is convenient to do so for example it might be easier to grab a quick bowl of cereal in the morning before we start our day than it would be to cook a more timeconsuming mealrnrni hope that helps do you have any other questions about this topic,1
not just the greatest playwright  but the greatest english writer  he also wrote poetry  on his own  he coined or first attested to  over 1700 words and numerous phrases   url0  that all english speakers still use today  among the words are  assassination    luggage    dawn   and  eyeball   and phrases include  good riddance    household words   and  knock knock  who s there   he did this by changing nouns into verbs  verbs into adjectives  or putting words together that had never been put together before  and occasionally by inventing words out of thin air  shakespeare also integrated characterization and plot in a new way  and brought depth to his characters that was previously unheard of in western theater  he was the first writer to use an  inner monologue   where his actors revealed their psychology  their inner turmoil and motivations by thinking out loud  prior to shakespeare  monologues typically did little more than introduce characters or scenes  they did not provide a glimpse into the mind of a character  throughout his life  he experimented with and perfected blank verse  poetry without rhyme   and in so doing established a new writing style that other writers would build upon for centuries after his death  none of these accomplishments even touch upon the beauty of his language  which is rich  contradictory  and full of extended metaphors and puns  many of which were considered quite vulgar and were greeted enthusiastically by his audiences  shakespeare is nt my favorite writer  by any stretch  but the imprint he has left on western culture and the english language itself is difficult to overstate  url0 he seems average now because he invented everything you are familiar with  not only that  but he did them so well that people still enjoy them today  shakespeare is often taught badly in schools  which does nt help  most people i ve spoken to who dislike shakespeare were sat down and taught it off the page with emphasis on metres and rhythms  and symbols and so on  another problem is that because shakespeare s plays codified  if not straight  out invented  many of the tropes of modern fiction  people tend to look back and say  well  it s just your standard feuding  families  romance  is nt it   and forget that he did it  first   the beatles suffer from the same thing sometimes  the other trouble is that shakespeare tends to get put on a big pedestal as the greatest playwright  which makes it more difficult to say you do nt like it  i m an actor and a big fan of shakespeare  but even i ca nt find much to love in  king john   for instance ,0
adam and eve would represent a genetic bottleneck in the history of humanity  if we are to assume that all humans are descended from adam and eve  then there would have to be enough time between when they lived and modern times to account for the genetic mutation and variation that exists across the whole of humanity as a species  and not just physical appearance differences  eye color  height  skin tone  facial and muscle structure  etc   but also genetic diseases and disorders  simply put  given what we know about the rate at which human genes mutate  it is extremely unlikey that all of humanity descended from just 2 people  especially in as short a time span as the rest of their story would suggest  i m not sure what your question is   but here is a nice imagery explination of evolution  life changes over time    url0 all life started out as small prokaryotes and envolved later to eukaryotes etc  look at a photograph of you when you were 10 years old  compare it to a photograph of your father at 10  switch father for mother if you re female   you probably look a lot alike  compare your father s photograph with a photograph of  his  father at 10  they probably look a lot alike  and your picture probably does nt look quite as much like your grandfather s as your father s does  now do the same thing with your grandfather and  his  father  your great  grandfather  we ll probably have to pretend here because your great  grandfather may not have had any photographs taken of him at 10 years old  pretend we had photographs of your whole family tree  going back as many generations as we want  if we compare any one of your ancestors to his father  they ll probably look a lot alike  but the farther back we go the less they ll look like you  that is  there is gradual change from one generation to the next  if we go back far enough  we ll find a picture of one of your ancestors that clearly is not human or  more precisely  not  homo sapiens   but since it was such a gradual change  we wo nt be able to find  in our stack of pictures  an ancestor of yours who was clearly human and whose father was clearly not human  starting with you  who is clearly  homo sapiens   we ll go back a million generations and see your ancestors who are  australopithecus  and look something like modern chimpanzees  go back 50 million generations and your father s father s  father s father looked something like an opossum  go back 500 million generations and your ancestors may have been trilobites  which look kinda like modern crabs  as we go through this stack of 500000000 photographs of your paternal ancestors  every single individual looks very similar to his father and looks very similar to his son  no where will we be able to find a break and say  ah  this is where a new species starts   but  if we look just at the top photograph  of you  and the bottom photograph  a trilobite   we can see that you are very  very different  now i can finally answer your question  if adam and eve we the first man and woman and all people are descendants of them  then adam is somewhere in the stack of photographs  there is no first  homo sapiens   it blends gradually into the ancestor species  there ca nt be a first human being  because that person s father and mother looked very similar to him  tldr  who are adam and eve s parents ,0
so far we have a case for yes and no  i believe the correct answer is maybe you mention that most of your expenses are in dollars which is definitely correct but there is an important complication that i will try to simplify greatly here  many of the goods you buy are priced on the international market a good example is oil or are made from combinations of these goods  when the dollar is strong the price of oil is low but when the dollar is weak the price of oil is high however when you buy stuff like services think a back massage then you pay the person in dollars and the person you are paying just wants dollars so the strength of the dollar doesnt really matter most peoples expenses are a mix of things that are priced internationally and locally with a bias toward local expenses  if they also have a mix of investments some of which are international and depend on the strength of the dollar and some are domestic and do not then they dont have to worry much about the strengthweakness of the dollar later when they sell their investments and buy what they want  if the dollar is weak than the international goods will be more expensive but at the same time international part of their portfolio will be worth more if you plan on retiring in a different country or have 100 of your investments in emerging market stocks than it is worth thinking about either currency hedging or changing your investment mix  however for many people a good mix of domestic and international investments covers much of the risk that their currency will weaken while offering the benefits of diversification  the best part is you dont need to guess if the dollar will get stronger or weaker tldr if you want your portfolio to not depend on currency moves then hedge  if you want your retirement to not depend on currency moves then have a good mix of local and unhedged international investments,0
it s called musical synthesis and there are a few flavors  the types of machines that do it are called synthesizers  and they fall into two categories  analog and digital  analog uses electronics to generate and process a signal represented by voltages  digital uses microprocessors to edit bits that represent the signal  there are  generalizing here  three flavors of synth  spectral  sample based  and physical modelling  sample based is probably the easiest to grasp  you start with recorded audio  and fuck with how it s played back  the easiest thing to do is change where in the recorded audio you play back  you take out slices of the audio and play them individually  depending on who you ask  this is the oldest form of synthesis with tape machines  it s called granular synthesi  where the slices of audio are called  grains   you can also do cool stuff like pitch shifting  the devices that do this are called  samplers  and they have special ways of shifting pitch of recorded audio  you record one or more recordings of say a piano  then shift the pitch of those samples to emulate a real piano  you do nt need to use a real instrument  you can take random shit and mess with it to create interesting noises  what s popular is to take many synth sounds and load them into a sampler  this is called  resampling  or  resynthesis  and it s used to make some of those crazy bass lines in dubstep and drum n bass  spectral synthesis is probably the widest variety  but all of them work the same way  you design a system to generate a bunch of frequencies  then fuck with them  the simplest is subtractive  you use a special electronic component called an oscillator that makes a waveform  it  oscillate  or repeats a regular way  giving it a pitch  the shape of the wave make different frequencies come out above the pitch  then you use filters to carve away at the generated frequencies  another method is additive synthesis  you generate each frequency individually and change the levels of them over time  this is really inefficient  but can give powerful results  then you have fm  or frequency modulation synthesis  it takes multiple oscillators  and uses their output to modulate the frequency of other oscillators  this generates wild frequency spectrums and is popular these days in deep house  dubstep  and electro music  it was also predominant in the 80s  a lot of vintage cheese comes from fm  then you ve got physical modelling  the idea here is that you want to create a mathematical model of a real instrument or physical effect  then use a computer to implement the model  what s cool is you can do crazy shit  like make a model of a mile long piano or a clarinet that s plucked like a guitar  things that are impossible in the real world but we can still create models of  and hear how they sound  want to know what it would sound like if a dog licked a snare drum head with the force of a truck  physical modelling can tell you  well  it helps if you know how a speaker works  a speaker recreates sound by vibrating a magnet back and forth  basically making a wave of air almost identical to the noise that was recorded  strings in a guitar or a reed in a saxophone behave much in the same way  that said  you really do nt need to use a  recorded  sound to simply move a magnet back and forth  you can move a magnet back and forth however you want  easiest way to do that is a certain amount in one direction and a certain amount in the other  that gets you an absurdly simple  sine wave   url0    google it  the other synth sounds are either similar ideas like  what happens when i do this with a speaker  or  what if i play an existing recording and tell the speaker to move really weird as it plays   so synth sounds are really not so much a computer making music  but a computer   playing a speaker  like a human would with a violin  i m on mobile so it s uncomfortable to explain subtractive synthesis  but have you ever looked at a sound wave  the ups and downs of a sound wave represent the approximate position of the speaker  the faster the speaker vibrates  the higher the frequency of the waves  the waves appear closer together   and the higher the pitch of the sound  the farther a speaker vibrates  the higher it s amplitude  the waves appear taller   and the higher the volume of the sound  at the lowest layer of the synthesizer  values from  for example  1 to 1 are mapped over a time period  where 1 would be a fully depressed come  and 1 would be a fully outward cone  the bitrate of an audio stream determines how many distinct values over this range it can represent  sounds with lower bitrates are limited to sounding metallic or robotic  whereas higher bitrates allow the digital noise to better approximate smooth  analogue waves ,0
essentially it stays upright by the same principles as  this guy   url0   vast oversimplification  but you get the idea  in addition to stabilizing fins  the main reason are the ballast tanks  all ships have these in some form but cruise ship and transport ships rely on them heavily  ballast tanks can empty with water providing extra buoyancy or fill with water to provide extra weight to lower the center of gravity thus balancing the ships in both rough and calm seas  ballast tanks are crucial devices to the function of most large vessels and were a critical invention to allow modern massive tonnage ships  these tanks have some interesting uses too such as overfilling them to weigh the ship down even more allowing it to pass under low bridges  witnessing container ships do this is a sight in of itself  a lot of larger ships have stabilizer fins on them as well as gyroscopes  they basically assist in keeping this ship level when cruising  the fins themselves have been in use since the 1930s url0,0
both the element and the planet were named for the roman god mercury  of whom a defining attribute was his speed  mercury was the quickest moving  star like object  visible to ancient peoples  and the element is a quick flowing fluid  to add to the other comment about the roman god  in the ancient studies of astrology and alchemy each of the parts of the solar system that were known about had a metal associated with them   the others are here   url0   only the element mercury is named after its planet  but like many elements it has been known by other names  it is also called quicksilver or  hydrargyrum  which means water  silver and explains the chemical symbol hg  i did nt know any of this myself until just now  when i searched for it on google  i m just saying  uranium  neptunium  and plutonium were discovered relatively recently  and specifically named after planets  mercury was discovered before the ium suffix was in use  and was named after the roman god  the planet mercury also happened to be named after the roman god  but that was incidental ,0
when you finish urinating the muscles in your bladder and urethra the tube that carries urine out of your body relax and this can cause a feeling of shivers or shudders this is a normal physical reaction and is not a cause for concernrnrnsometimes the feeling of shivers after urinating can be accompanied by a sensation of warmth or a feeling of relief this is because the act of urinating can help to reduce the pressure in your bladder which can be uncomfortable when it is fullrnrnits also possible that the feeling of shivers after urinating is related to the release of endorphins which are chemicals produced by your body that can give you a feeling of pleasure or wellbeingrnrnoverall the feeling of shivers after urinating is a common and normal physical reaction that is experienced by many people there is no need to be concerned unless you are experiencing other symptoms along with the shivers such as pain or discomfort while urinating if you are experiencing these symptoms its a good idea to speak with a healthcare professional for further evaluation,1
i assume us as mhoranpsprep edited although im not sure irs necessarily means us it definitely used to also include britains inland revenue but they changed  us stockbrokers do not normally withhold on either dividendsinterestdistributions or realized capital gains especially since gains might be reduced or eliminated by later losses they can be required to apply backup withholding to dividends and interest dont ask how i know  you are normally required to pay most of your tax during the year defined as within 10 or 1000 whichever is more by withholding andor estimated payments thus if the tax on your income including your recent gain will exceed your withholding by 10 and 1000 you should either adjust your withholding or make an estimated payment or some combination although even if you have a job the last week of december is too late for you to adjust withholding significantly or even to make a timely estimated payment if earlier in the year means in an earlier quarter as defined for tax janmar aprmay juneaug septdec see httpswwwirsgovbusinessessmallbusinessesselfemployedestimatedtaxes and for details its link to publication 505 but a safe harbor may apply since you say this is your first time to have capital gains if you did not owe any income tax for last year and were a citizen or resident or except very high earners if you did owe tax and your withholding plus estimated payments this year is enough to pay last years tax you are exempt from the form 2210 penalty and you have until the filing deadline normally april 15 but this year april 18 due to weekend and holiday to pay the latter is likely if your job and therefore payroll income and withholding this year was the same or nearly the same as last year and there was no other big change other than the new capital gain also note that gains on investments held more than one year are classified as longterm and taxed at lower rates which reduces the tax you will owe all else equal and thus the payments you need to make but your wording bought and sold  earlier this year suggests your holding was not longterm and shortterm gains are taxed as ordinary income added if the state you live in has a state income tax similar considerations apply but to smaller amounts ttbomk all states tax capital gains and other investment income other than interest on exempt bonds and dont necessarily give the lower rates for longterm gains and all states i have lived in have must have withholding or estimated payments rules generally similar to the federal ones though not identical,0
card processing companies discourage cash advance activities because they are generally more expensive for the customer than regular purchases when a cardholder takes out a cash advance they are typically charged a higher interest rate and fees than they would be for a regular purchase made with their credit cardin addition cash advances do not typically have a grace period which means that interest begins accruing on the advance as soon as it is taken out this can quickly add up especially if the cardholder is not able to pay off the advance in a timely mannerfinally card processing companies may also discourage cash advances because they can be a sign of financial distress on the part of the cardholder this can increase the risk of default which can have negative consequences for both the cardholder and the card issuer,1
ctrlshiftp is not typically used for pasting because the ctrl and shift keys are used to modify the behavior of other keys or keyboard shortcuts for example in many programs pressing ctrlp opens the print dialog box and pressing shiftp might change the behavior of another keyboard shortcut the letter v is often used as a keyboard shortcut for the paste function because it is easy to type and not already in use for other purposes in most programs for example you can use the keyboard shortcut ctrlv to paste text or other content in many programs its important to note that different programs may use different keyboard shortcuts for different functions so its always a good idea to check the programs documentation or help resources to learn which keyboard shortcuts are available,1
sure when you play a record on a record player the record spins around in a circle the needle also called the stylus is attached to the arm of the record player and follows the grooves in the record as it spins the grooves on a record are like a spiral staircase that goes around and around the center of the record as the record spins the needle follows the grooves and vibrates up and down creating sound waves that you can hear through the speakersnow heres the part that might be a little confusing even though the record is spinning at a constant speed the needle has to travel a shorter distance as it moves from the outer edge of the record to the center this is because the grooves on a record are more closely spaced together as they get closer to the center so even though the record is spinning at a constant speed the needle has to travel a shorter distance as it moves from the outer edge to the center this is why the needle moves in smaller and smaller circles as it plays the recordi hope this helps if you have any more questions just let me know,1

filming a movie takes thousands of people from assistant directors and personal assistants to caterers and drivers  their salaries alone are massively expensive  if you re filming on location  imagine the cost of getting people and equipment to the locations as well as the cost of staying there  a movie is made up of a million little parts  all of which cost a little something and add up to those ridiculous numbers we see  there are many aspects to film making which make it so expensive  such as     cgi  sfx    studios employ a vast range of experts that help craft the visuals  sometimes they employ multiple companies to achieve this     staff    films have a vast amount of workers  ranging from 100  1000 for most films  some of them are payed ridiculously high wages     marketing    it costs millions of dollars to advertise for a big movie  sometimes this figure is not included in the budget      general expenses    this covers the cost of transportation  set building  equipment etc  1000 s of combined man hours can go into special effects depending on the movie  at anywhere from a hundred to two hundred dollars a man hour plus 100 s of thousands in equipment and r  d  shit gets expensive real quick ,0
hair turns gray when the cells that produce pigment called melanocytes stop producing pigment or produce less pigment this can happen for a variety of reasons including genetics age and certain medical conditions some people may start going gray at a younger age due to genetics while others may not start going gray until they are older its also possible for people to have a mix of gray and nongray hair with some hairs being gray and others being their natural colorrnrnin your cousins case it sounds like he has a lot of gray hair at the age of 26 this could be due to genetics or other factors but its not uncommon for people to start going gray at a young age its also possible that your cousins nickname the silver fox is a playful way of acknowledging his gray hair,1
salt is a preservative in food because it helps to prevent the growth of bacteria bacteria need water to grow and salt helps to remove water from the environment when salt is added to food it draws out some of the water and creates an environment that is less hospitable for bacteria to grow this can help to extend the shelf life of the foodrnrnas for the second part of your question it is possible for food to become less salty over time this can happen if the food is stored in a humid environment as the salt may dissolve in the water and be absorbed by the food it can also happen if the food is cooked or processed in a way that removes some of the salt however in general the salt content of food does not change significantly over time unless it is actively being removed,1

in sports like hockey and baseball the playoffs are a long tournament where many teams compete to see who is the best because it is a long tournament it is not fair if a team can be eliminated from the playoffs just because they had one bad day by having the playoffs be a bestofseven series it gives each team more chances to show how good they are if a team has a bad game they still have the opportunity to come back and win the series in american football the playoffs are a shorter tournament and there are fewer teams because there are fewer teams it is possible to have a singleelimination format where the loser of each game is eliminated from the playoffs this can make the playoffs more exciting because every game is a mustwin situation and one bad day can end a teams season,1

moths use lunar navigation  they look up in the sky and use the moon to traject where they are and where they are going  man made lights mess with that cause they can seem like moonlight to the moths  moths use incoming light from the moon like a compass so they keep their flight paths angled in the same direction  when a bright light that is nt the moon is visible to them  it overrides their sense of direction  like holding a magnet close to a compass needle  the needle will point toward the magnet instead of pointing to magnetic north  the bright light does the same thing to a moth  they re not attracted to bright lights  they re confused by them  they re accustomed to keeping a bright light source  the moon  in one place to fly in a steady direction  this works when the light source is effectively an infinite distance away  but when the light source is nearby  your porch light   keeping the light in the same place causes the moth to  spiral inward   url0   we perceive it as being attracted to it  when it s simply a side effect of a change in the moth s environment ,0
share price is based on demand  assuming the same amount of shares are made available for trade then stocks with a higher demand will have a higher price  so say a company has 1000 shares in total and that company needs to raise 100 they decide to sell 100 shares for 1 to raise their 100 if there is demand for 100 shares for at least 1 then they achieve their goal but if the market decides the shares in this company are only worth 50 cents then the company only raises 50 so where do they get the other 50 they needed well one option is to sell another 100 shares the dilution comes about because in the first scenario the company retains ownership of 900 or 90 of the equity in the second scenario it retains ownership of only 800 shares or 80 of the equity the benefit to the company and shareholders of a higher price is basically just math any multiple of shares times a higher price means there is more value to owning those shares therefore they can sell fewer shares to raise the same amount  a lot of starts up offer employees shares as part of their remuneration package because cash flow is typically tight when starting a new business so if youre trying to attract the best and brightest its easier to offer them shares if they are worth more than those of company with a similar opportunity down the road share price can also act as something of a credit score in that a higher share price may reflect a more credit worthy company and therefore may make it easier for that company to obtain credit all else being equal it also makes it more expensive for a competitor to take over a company the higher the share price so it can offer some defensive and offensive advantages all ceteris paribus of course,0

i encourage you to think of this home purchase decision as a chance to buy into a community that you want your children to grow up in  try to find a place where you will be happy for the next 20 years not just the next 2 or 7 years in your situation option 1 seems like a bad idea  it will create an obstacle to having children instead of establishing a place for them to grow up in option 2 is close to buying a house on a layaway plan  it offers the most financial flexibility  it also could result in the best longterm outcome because you will buy in an established area and you will know exactly what quality house you will have  but you and your fiancã© need to ask yourselves some hard questions  are you willing to put up with the mess and hassles of remodelling  are you good at designing such projects  can you afford to pay for the projects as they occur  or if you need to finance them can you get a heloc to cover them especially if you and your fiancã© do much of the work yourselves break down the projects into small enough pieces that you can quickly finish off whatever you are working on at the time and be happy living in the resulting space  you do not want to be nagging your husband about an unfinished project forever  or silently resenting that a project never got wrapped up  i posted some suggestions for incrementally finishing a basement on the home improvement stack exchange if you are up to the job of option 2 it is less risky than option 3  option 3 has several risks you dont know what sort of people will live in the neighborhood 5  20 years from now  will the homes be owneroccupied  or rentals  will your neighbors care about raising children well  or will lots of kids grow up in broken homes   will the schools be good  disappointing  or dangerous  whereas in an established neighborhood you can see what the neighborhood is currently like and how it has been changing unless you custombuild or remodel you dont control the quality of the construction  some neighborhoods built by pulte in the last 10 years were riddled with construction defects you will be paying upfront for features you dont need yet  you might never need some of them  and some of them might interfere with what you realize later on might be better in stable markets new homes especially ones with lots of upgrades often decline in value during the first few years  this is because part of the value is in the newness and being uptodate with the latest fads  this part of the value wears off over time are the homes at the edge of town already within reasonable walking distance of parks schools church grocery stores et cetera  might the commute from the edge of town to work get worse over the next 5  20 years,0
engineers are able to build subway tunnels under already built infrastructure by using a machine called a tunnel boring machine tbm a tbm is a very large machine that digs through the ground and creates a tunnel in its place the tbm digs through the ground using a spinning cutting wheel the dirt and rock that the tbm digs up is carried away through a conveyor belt or truckrnrnwhen engineers want to build a subway tunnel under a skyscraper they have to be very careful they have to make sure that the tunnel is deep enough so that it doesnt disturb the foundations of the skyscraper they also have to make sure that the tunnel is strong enough to hold up the weight of the skyscraperrnrnto make sure everything is safe engineers use special machines to measure the ground and make sure it is stable they also use computers to model the tunnel and make sure it is strong enough if everything looks good then the tbm can start digging the tunnelrnrnits a very complicated process but with the right tools and careful planning engineers are able to build subway tunnels under already built infrastructure,1

the god particle is a nickname for the  higgs boson   url0  i thought it was referencing this  god s debris   url0  which is a good read in itself  but the higg s boson answer is probably the correct one  on the scale of the really small  everything you see and feel  matter  forces  energy  is made out of tiny tiny building blocks called particles  there s years  worth of study in this field  which is known as quantum mechanics  but it s important to understand one major part known as the standard model  the standard model is essentially a periodic table of elements for all of the different types of particles  some particles make up matter  like atoms   others act as messengers and transmit forces  think magnetic forces   but what s important is that the standard model is supposed to explain why matter and forces act the way we do  the good news  the standard model does this  and it does it  insanely well   it makes prediction after prediction and continues to match up with experiment  however  there s an important part missing  what gives things mass  despite a century of understand into what makes stuff stick together or explode or attract  we do nt know why anything has mass  physicists are really smart  though  and in the 1960s a bunch of them figured out this complicated idea involving a new particle which would ordain other particles with mass  the particle was named the higgs boson  after one of those physicists  peter higgs  once the theorists conjecture the existence of a new particle  such as the higgs boson  it becomes the job of the experimentalists to find it  the problem  however  is that the experimentalists can not observe the higgs directly  they must look for its tracks  this is pretty analogous to trying to find a deer in the woods by looking in freshly fallen snow for deer prints  now imagine there s also been a stampede which escaped from the local zoo and you have to still find that one deer s prints among the stamped snow left from the stampede  as you can imagine  that takes a while  to find the higgs  it also means it takes an entirely new  more powerful instrument to try to find it  the large hadron collider  lhc  at cern  a research facility in europe  the amount of time  money and effort being poured into finding this one particle has led to perennial news coverage  where the higgs boson was eventually nicknamed  the god particle   you ve actually asked this question at an exciting time  on tuesday  1213  the researchers at cern are going to release a major batch of data and analysis from the lhc  which should contain information on whether the higgs boson actually exists  if they find it  it will be a major vindication of decades of work and the completion of a major unanswered part of the standard model  if they  do nt  find it  the experimentalists will be disappointed but it will lead to huge theoretical questions about what could be wrong with our understanding of reality  either way  exciting stuff ,0
when you stretch  you create micro tears in your muscles  your brain releases endorphins  the feel good stuff  to cover it  as long as the tears are small  you feel good  when the tears are big  like when you tear a pectoral muscle  sorry bud  them endorphins just wo nt cut it and you scream bloody murder  when a person stretches the circulation is measurably increased  the contracting muscles squeeze more blood back to the heart and replenishes oxygen to the lungs  the chest expands drawing in more air  sometimes as a person stretches they also yawn sometimes  this also enriches the bloodstream with more oxygen and feels good to the body  why does this feel good  for a number of reasons  first  the brain is cleared and receives more oxygen  this is especially helpful when waking from a night s sleep  after a nap  or even after sitting for a sustained period of time  when the body is at rest it uses less oxygen  breathing becomes shallower and the blood circulates more slowly  stretching galvanizes the body s metabolism and kicks it up a few notches â€” almost like turning up a rheostat  all this activity releases endorphins to the brain  in some cases the endorphins gently stimulate the same region of the brain that is stimulated during an orgasm  but at a much lower level  this gives the body a mild feeling of euphoria accompanied by a sense of refreshment  psychology then comes into play and emotions  a long  satisfying stretch buoys the emotions and also elicits a mild feeling of well  being  all of this from simply stretching  yes  that is why it feels so good and at the right moment of the day little else is as satisfying as a good  long stretch  was wondering this yesterday  but was to lazy to post it  now i know,0
they are  but in spanish h is nt pronounced like h in english   habanero  in spanish would be pronounced  abanero   because habanero translates to  from havana  while jalepeno translates to  from xalapa   spanish is weird like that  it s a spanish derivation and would be pronounced  h  alapeã±o  whereas habanero has a silent h  as in  a  banero ,0
it does nt  it  enables you to see things in slow motion and still have it be smooth   since 24fps feels smooth  i you take 24fps and slow it down by half you get a chopping feeling video  if you slow 1000fps down by half you get 500fps  by 75  and it s still 250fps  and so on  edit  maths they shoot it at 1000 frames per second  you can think of it like taking 1000 pictures in one second  and then play it back at a significantly slower frame rate  commonly 24 frames per second   that means that something that took 1 second when they filmed it would take 41 seconds to play those 1000  pictures  back  fps is the amount of frames per second you re recording  when you move it into an editing software  you can change that into a slower  more streamable  frame rate  ie 60fps  which is what the cinemas tend to use  which will make your video slo  mo  for example  if you filmed at 1000fps  you re capturing 11000th of a second per frame  if you make it so it plays back at a  standard  frame rate like 60  you ll see 601000ths of a second s recording in any singe second  this means that each second of recording time is stretched across 16 and a bit seconds  therefore playing back much slower ,0
in computer programming gene expression programming gep is an evolutionary algorithm that creates computer programs or models these computer programs are complex tree structures that learn and adapt by changing their sizes shapes and composition much like a living organism and like living organisms the computer programs of gep are also encoded in simple linear chromosomes of fixed length thus gep is a genotypeâ€“phenotype system benefiting from a simple genome to keep and transmit the genetic information and a complex phenotype to explore the environment and adapt to it,0
electric vehicles are more practical when they only have to travel short distances and have easy access to charging facilities  a bus that makes the same 1 mile loop every day fits that description  a bus that travels a couple hundred miles a day  not as much  the problem with most electric vehicles is that  unless they stay on charging rails  they have a pretty limited range  they can only go a few dozen miles  up to a few hundred on the state of the art models  before needing to be plugged in or to swap out their battery  airports are great for electric buses because  while they may drive around a lot  it s all in a fairly small geographic space  they re never far from a charging station  and can even install charging cables along their routes  airports also serve the function of being the ambassadors to an entire region  travelers often judge a city by the quality of its airport  cities are thus willing to chose more expensive  more environmentally friendly options at the airport in order to make a good impression  electric buses require infrastructure  if they are the trolley type  they get their power from overhead wires  if they are electric vehicles  they need somewhere to plug in and recharge their batteries  either way it s easiest to roll out an electric bus program on a smaller scale  like an airport  because you either need to build a bunch of overhead wires  or a big depot with lots of charging stations for the whole fleet  there are larger scale electric bus operations in the world  though  vancouver  british columbia has overhead wires on most of the major roads for trolley style electric buses ,0
i m not too well versed in the biology of apes  but i d venture to guess that it s primarily in the physical structure of their vocal tracts  we know that they have the physical capability to make speech sounds because they make noises with their mouth  and we know they have the mental capability to understand language because we can teach it to them  but the primate s vocal tract is shaped differently from the humans  the vocal tract is the area of the head that humans use to shape and manipulate the sound coming out of their mouth  and extends from the front of the lips  up to the nose  and back to the uvula  the punching bag thing  and the pharynx behind it  we have decided among ourselves that various shapes mean certain things  the human vocal tract is insanely nuanced and precise because for millenia one of our evolutionary advantages has been the capability of speech  so our vocal tract has become physically refined far more than any other animal  the variety of sounds we are physically capable of making is staggering  and in fact dwarfs the limited notion we have of the alphabet  url0 the previous link is the international phonetic alphabet which is what speech professionals and linguists have decided are all of the sounds that humans use in languages around the world  it actually excludes sounds not used in languages  so that chart is not even the limit of our speech capabilities  but back to the apes  i would guess that the vocal tract of the ape if much less refined  their tongues  jaws  lips  soft palates  pharynx  nasal cavities and uvulas are probably much less flexible and agile  meaning that the number of sounds they can shape are fewer  if the apes had their own international phonetic alphabet  it would not be as extensive and it would not correspond to ours  it might not be out of the realm of possibility to document the sounds that apes can make and create a language out of those sounds and teach it to them  but for them to learn a human language would  i presume  be biologically impossible  for a quick and similar example  imagine someone who ca nt roll their r s  that person is biologically incapable of fully speaking any language with a rolled r for the apes  almost all of the sounds we use are equivalent to that  they ca nt do them  the only difference is that any unimpaired human can learn how to roll an r they have the biological equipment  apes do not  they ca nt  because they do nt have the ability to think in  abstractions  like we can  almost all the words in a human language are like  handles  that stand for an  abstract idea   the exception are words that are  proper names  such as  john  which stand for one perceptual object only  a person named john  making abstractions is something only humans appear to be able to do  for example  every tree and bush in the physical world is different  different colours  different shapes and sizes  when you just  look  at one of them  and do nt think about it  you see it like an ape does  the  abstraction  for  tree   however  is different  it s an idea  it stands for every tree that has ever existed  and is nt any particular shape  it is nt red or green or brown  the brain has deleted every  particular  property and made an abstract category holder which can describe all particular trees  even imagined ones or cartoon ones that do nt actually exist  we can hypothesize that  the automatic mental process  ability  of creating these abstract categories  deleting their particular measurements  and giving them handles  words  is absent in apes and other animals with brains  they can  sign language falls under the human language category  yes  researchers managed to teach primates to communicate at about a 3  4 year old human level using sign language  a quick google should show a few articles  some highlights from what i remember  the can form very basic sentence structure  ie  me hungry  they can express emotions such as sadness  or fear  they have a sense of self  very fascinating ,0
survival of the fittest is really an outmoded concept  nature does nt pick only the strongest  fastest  smartest  survival of the  good enough  is more realistic  and what constitutes good enough changes both with environment and time  there s no  ultimate  goal to which evolution is advancing  something extremely fit and useful today could be a huge detriment tomorrow  in a weird way  we already do  for the first 4 billion years of life on this planet  life was more of a  sludge  than anything else  it was all one  celled organisms  only in the last billion have we gotten multiple cells and specialized bits and pieces like teeth and ears  the  fitness  of an animal is nt just how strong  fast or smart it is  in fact  having those qualities can even be a bad thing depending on the circumstances  a barnacle would nt benefit much from being able to move fast  for instance  if you re putting all your energy into being smart  you ll have to obtain a  lot  more food to power your brain  a creature living somewhere where calories are scarce would nt benefit from that  if you re extra fast or strong  you re going to need a bigger heart to pump blood  which can carry extra risks or complications  if that helps you catch food or escape predators  great  but if it causes you to die earlier than you might have  then that s not the  fittest  trait  the ways an organism can be  fit  are going to vary a lot depending on the environment ,0
bitcoin is often referred to as a virtual or digital currency it is decentralized meaning that it is not controlled by any government or financial institution and it is based on a distributed ledger technology called the blockchainhowever some people consider bitcoin to be a commodity rather than a currency this is because it is not widely accepted as a means of payment and does not have the same legal status as a fiat currency which is issued and backed by a governmentin the united states the commodity futures trading commission cftc has classified bitcoin as a commodity while the internal revenue service irs has treated it as property for tax purposes other countries and regulatory bodies have taken different approaches to classifying bitcoinultimately whether bitcoin is considered a commodity or a currency may depend on the context in which it is being used and the specific legal and regulatory framework in which it operates,1
when you yell you are making a lot of noise by forcing a lot of air through your vocal cords which are the two thin bands of muscle in your larynx voice box that vibrate to make sound when you speak or sing yelling puts a lot of strain on your vocal cords and over time this can cause them to become inflamed or swollen when your vocal cords are swollen it can be harder for them to vibrate properly which can make your voice sound hoarse or weak it can also be painful to talk or sing when your vocal cords are swollen the best way to avoid losing your voice from yelling is to take breaks when you are speaking loudly and to try to use your normal speaking voice as much as possible,1

here are three things you may want to consider doing before the end of the year with your stock portfolioreview your portfolio take some time to review your current portfolio and make sure it still aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance consider if you need to make any changes such as rebalancing your asset allocation or selling off underperforming stocksharvest tax losses if you have any stocks that have decreased in value since you purchased them you may be able to sell them and use the capital losses to offset any capital gains you have realized during the year this can help reduce your tax liabilitymake any necessary taxrelated moves if you are planning to sell any stocks that have appreciated in value you may want to do so before the end of the year to take advantage of any lower tax rates that may be available you should also consider making any charitable donations or contributions to taxadvantaged accounts such as a 401k or ira before the end of the year,1
standard quiz  trivia show  the players  scores are in  jeopardy  throughout because wrong answers subtract from their total  another gimmick is that the clues are provided in the form of a statement and the participants have to respond in the form of a question  3 rounds  jeopardy  double jeopardy  and final jeopardy jeopardy has 6 categories of 5 questions each  ranging from  200 to  1000   example  player  i ll take websites for  400  alex  alex trebek  it s a place where user  submitted links are voted up or down by the rest of the users  player   rings in  what is reddit  failing to phrase your response as a question counts as incorrect  but you have a few seconds to correct your mistake if you forgot  double jeopardy is the same  but the values are doubled  ranging from  400 to  2000 per question  answer   the first two rounds have daily doubles as well  one in the first round  two in the second   when selecting a clue  the player gets a special clue just for them  the other players ca nt ring in   and they get to wager how much they want to earn  lose on the result  so making something a  true daily double  means betting your entire score  final jeopardy is like a daily double for all players  the category is given  players get to decide how much they want to bet on a single question  then they hear the clue and have 30 seconds to write down their response   edit  daily doubles are hidden  so there s no way to know which clue is going to be one  they tend to be in the lower half  ie higher  scoring clues  of the board  to add a few more details to the other excellent descriptions  the winner from the show gets to come back the next night and play against two new contestants  this continues until the person is defeated  the interesting thing about jeopardy is that it s a show where you have to have pretty good breadth of knowledge to do well  and contestants appear to be pretty smart individuals  on many other game shows in the us  contestants seem to be more like  regular people  and are nt necessarily that exceptional  yet the prizes for jeopardy are nt that lavish  you can be a jeopardy winner and take home less than  10000  depending on how the game goes  taken together it means that being a contestant on jeopardy  or even just playing along at home  has more status  intellectual cachet than competing on  watching other shows  contestants are given the opportunity to answer questions with associated monetary values  a correct answer credits the contestant with the associated value  an incorrect answer debits the contestant in the same amount  so there s a penalty to just guessin   the questions are well known for being challenging  but the range is quite broad  some questions have obvious answers anyone could guess  others have obvious answers but are worded in such a way as to make them tricky to guess  still others are questions you either know the answer to or you do nt  who was henry viii buried next to  either you know that or you do nt   it was jane seymour   the gimmick of the game is that the  questions  are phrased as if they were answers  and the contestants are required to provide the questions to which those are answers  in the above example  the  question  might have been  she s the wife of henry viii next to whom he was buried   and an  answer  might be   who was jane seymour   this is a formality more than anything  many consider the game to be  slightly  more challenging because the  questions  must first be parsed to figure out what the correct response needs to be  first you must unpack the  question   then you have to come up with the correct answer to the question  then you must phrase the correct answer in a way that s acceptable to the judges  this makes the whole game a  bit  tricker and more interesting than just answering questions  how much tricker  and how much more interesting  is of course in the eye of the beholder ,0
all numbers inside a computer are stored in binary  which means they are made up of 1s and 0s  each digit in binary is called a  bit   so the number of bits indicated the number of digits it can work with  in decimal  a 2  digit number can be a number between 0  99  and a 4  digit number can be a number between 0  9999  well  it s the same in binary  the more bits  the higher the numbers you can work with  what difference does this make  well  each byte in memory has an  address  which is a number  so the more digits  bits  you use  the more addresses you can handle  and so the more memory you can handle  it also affects how numbers are handled internally  it can take longer to do certain operations involving big numbers  you might not even realise that the computer is using big numbers  if the computer ca nt represent them directly  some computers can handle only 32  bit software  because either the processor or the operating system only knows how to run in 32  bit mode  other computers can handle 32  bit or 64  bit software  it s usually a good idea to run 64  bit software when you can  but for everyday use it probably makes very little difference  the terms 32  bit and 64  bit refer to the way a computer s processor  also called a cpu   handles information  the 64  bit version of windows handles large amounts of random access memory  ram  more effectively than a 32  bit system  url0 basically a 64 bit computer can do tasks generally better than a 32 bit one  this is not exactly eli5  sorry  these numbers refer to the bit width of the fsb or front side  bus  this bus is also the maximum width of a single instruction  address  or any other piece of data which is passed to the cpu in a single clock  or system step  the important information for this is about an address  it is a pointer to a location of memory  much like the address points to the location of your house when using a map  it affects you by determining the exact maximum amount of memory you can install on your system  a 32  bit wide bus can pass a single 32  bit address in a single clock  this limits your maximum number of addresses to the largest number you can store in 32 bits  which is 4294967295 addresses  each to a unique byte  that all adds up to 4 gb of addressable memory  by moving to 64  bit  you can address more memory  a lot more  like 18446744073709551615 bytes more   184 exabytes  which is millions upon millions of terabytes  as computers get more advanced  programs tend to grow more complex and require more memory  thus facilitating the upgrade  programs have to be written in a programming language that can then be used by a compiler to generate machine  specific code  unfortunately  programs compiled for 32  bit systems can only see 32 bits  they do not support 64  bit operation  thus the developers have to recompile it for 64  bit systems  however  since people still use 32  bit systems it must stick around  therefore they make both versions available ,0

it is nt necessarily better  what matters is your overall caloric intake  be that in one meal daily or ten  the idea behind eating more meals is that you never really get that hungry  so you do nt overeat  its a myth from what i ve heard  some people think it will keep your metabolism running at peak performance for longer periods of time  but i remember reading studies a while back that said that that actually is nt the case  supposedly  it s because it psychologically makes it easier to control portions  nutrition is unaffected  and evidence even for the psychological effect is sketchy at best ,0
both video games and movies can potentially cause seizures in people who are susceptible to them however movies are generally watched for shorter periods of time than video games are played so the risk of a seizure occurring is generally lower with movies also the flashing lights and patterns that can trigger seizures are often more frequent and intense in video games than they are in movies thats why video games often include a warning about the risk of seizures but movies do not usually include such a warning,1
it is difficult for me to predict whether or not you will be approved for a car loan without more information there are many factors that lenders consider when evaluating loan applications including your credit score income debts and savingsyour credit score is an important factor that lenders consider when evaluating your loan application it is a threedigit number that reflects the information in your credit reports including your payment history credit utilization and the types of credit you have generally lenders prefer to work with borrowers who have high credit scores as they are considered to be less riskyyour income and debts are also important considerations for lenders they want to ensure that you have the financial resources to make your loan payments on time and in full they will look at your income debts and expenses to determine how much you can afford to borrowyour savings can also be a factor in the loan approval process some lenders may consider your savings as a sign of financial stability and may be more likely to approve your loan if you have a good amount of savingsit is also worth noting that different lenders have different lending criteria and may place a greater emphasis on certain factors it is always a good idea to shop around and compare offers from multiple lenders to find the best loan for you,1

the trinity distinguishes between persons and beings  or in layman terms one what and three who s  god is one what  being  with three who s  persons   each person is 100  god  co  equal  of equal power  and co  eternal  having existed forever   one person is not 13 of god because god is infinite and it is impossible to divide infinity into 3  the three persons are the father  the son  and the holy spirit  the father is unseen in heaven  the son is the image of the father  and the holy spirit works among believers  there is no appropriate analogy because god is unique and thus there is nothing in creation which can accurately describe him  the idea is that even though there are three parts they are the same thing  believers might describe it as parts of the body  while your arm is obviously different from your head  it s all you   here s a good visual on the trinity   url0   i have nt seen any better than this and it has no obvious errors as far as i can tell ,0
orchestral musicians often have to read their music on stage because the pieces they play are often very complex and have many different parts that are played by different instruments this means that it is difficult for a musician to memorize all of the different parts and play them correctly without being able to refer to the written music rock musicians on the other hand often play simpler music that is easier to memorize and they may only have to play one or a few different parts additionally rock bands often perform the same songs over and over again so the musicians have plenty of time to practice and memorize their parts before performing,1
its not easy to explain the reasons for discrimination against jews in a way that would be suitable for a fiveyearold but i will try to provide a brief and simplified explanation throughout history jews have often been the target of discrimination and persecution because of their religious beliefs and cultural practices in ancient times the romans conquered the land where many jews lived and imposed their own laws and customs on the conquered people this led to conflict and persecution of the jews in europe jews were often discriminated against and ostracized because they were seen as different and were often excluded from certain jobs and opportunities in some cases they were even forced to live in separate areas called ghettos during the 20th century the nazi regime in germany perpetrated the holocaust in which millions of jews were systematically murdered in concentration camps this was a horrific example of the extreme hate and discrimination that some people can harbor towards jews and other minority groups discrimination and prejudice against jews and other groups continue to be a problem in some parts of the world today its important to remember that all people deserve to be treated with respect and kindness regardless of their race religion or background,1
it s to safeguard against malfunctioning warning signs at the railroad crossing  trucks carrying hazardous material are required to stop in a lot  if not all  cases as well  former bus driver here  we are required to by law  it is a practice that forces you to stop  look and listen to check both directions for an oncoming train  since you can stop much easier than the train  it just makes sense  side note  if your car stalls on tracks with a train oncoming always move diagonal from the tracks in the direction of the train  this is the area least likely to be hit by debris  it s required for any vehicle carrying over a certain number of passengers  if the bus is empty  it does nt have to stop  if everyone had to stop at every crossing  it would cause traffic jams ,0

one of the main reasons china supports north korea aside from ideology is they do nt want millions of starving refugees coming across their border if the country collapses  china also likes having a buffer state between them and the heavily us allied south korea  anything that is good for the us  uk  france in any way is usually vetoed by either china or russia  that s just normal politics  china is also an ally of north korea  so they will generally not allow them any penalties if they can prevent it  it s a resolution that condemns north korea â€™s human rights record  particularly for its network of political prisons where atrocities are committed  if russia and china do nt veto the resolution then they will need to answer to their human rights record which in many ways is nt that much better than north korea s ,0
because there are business owners and stockholders out there looking for different ways to do things the tv ads during sunday morning news shows are even more obscure  defense contractors  food processing companies  etc  i m thinking that they want to build good will in the community  which will have positive benefits for them  example  government is about to pass a law that is beneficial to norfolk southern  that will be a lot easier if ns is  that nice railway company  rather than  that big evil corporation   example  manager of a local company is considering transport contacts  that norfolk southern company sure seems reputable  defence contractors do the same thing  even though a tiny number of people actually have any influence over defence contracts  the contracts are huge  advertising to the general public is worth it just so you reach the small number of people that buy your product  in some cases there is some sort of law they want passed that will favor their business and they are trying to buy some public goodwill  but with ibm i mean  just because they do nt sell to end consumers does nt mean they do nt have a ton of customers  pretty much any medium sized business will potentially buy from ibm  ibm salespeople are always taking my boss out to lunch ,0

they know where their home nest is  and can navigate back there using  magnetism   url0   the idea is that you raise the birds at military headquarters  then when they re adults  you cage them and take them with you on campaigns  to send messages back to headquarters  you tie a note to them and then let them free  and they ll fly back home  someone at headquarters keeps an eye out for returning birds and reads the attached notes  they do not work two  way  you can not tell a bird an arbitrary location to fly to  and headquarters can not communicate back to you in the same way  unless  of course  they have a captive bird that was raised where you are now  headquarters might keep a number of birds raised at specific outposts and use those to communicate to the nearest one to you  though  so you might say  headquarters  i m 140 miles south of outpost x and we re negotiating with the evil skeleton king  would you accept these terms    and headquarters might send a bird from outpost x home with the note  send a messenger 140 miles south with the message blah blah blah   birds specially bred for this can travel vast distances at pretty high speeds  and of course  are nt impeded by rivers or other obstacles like a human on horseback would be  so they can travel in a straight line  a bird dispatched from london at breakfast could be in berlin by dinner  the downside is that you have a limited number of birds  and that you have no way of knowing if your messages arrived on time or if the bird was killed en route  messenger birds are only used by hobbyists today because we obviously have much more instant and reliable forms of communication  i heard a rumour that skype is rolling out in westeros in season 5 though  in game of thrones the maesters know how to train the ravens  but they do nt know why  the children of the forest actually could send send the ravens and have them speak the messages to whomever they were sending  i know you were asking about real life  but i though the in universe answer would be nifty too  no  ravens are not  and have never been  used as birds to deliver messages   carrier pigeons   url0  are homing pigeons that can remember where they live and go back there when released  even if hundreds of miles away  the theory is that they learn the position growing up and flying around their home by learning  remembering that magnetic position on the earth  back in the day  even as recently as ww2  when these pigeons were caged up and taken away from their homes  when released by their masters   presumably with a message capsule attached to their legs   they flew home where the someone waited to read that message  this was one way communication only  the pigeons could only fly home  if you wanted two way communication  there must be a different set of homing pigeons on each end of the line of communication  whose home was at the  other end   at which point each distinct set could fly home when needed ,0

cats like boxes because they provide a sense of security and comfort when a cat is in a box they feel hidden and protected which can be very appealing to them cats are also naturally curious animals and boxes offer a small enclosed space to explore and play in boxes also help to satisfy a cats instinctual need to scratch and mark their territory when a cat scratches a box they are leaving their scent on it and marking it as their own cats also have a natural instinct to seek out small enclosed spaces because in the wild these types of spaces can provide protection from predators by hiding in a box a cat can feel safe and secure so when you see a cat fitting themselves into a small space its likely because they feel comfortable and secure there,1
microsoft assumes the user knows what they want and how to accomplish it  apple assumes they know what the user wants and what the best way to give it to the user is  i m bad at explaining it like you re 5  but i ll try to keep it simple  the main difference is that apple makes both the hardware and the software  whereas microsoft usually makes software only  the exception being zune   apple can make changes to the software and hardware so that they work better together  it would be like making your own clothes  sure  it can get complicated and take more time  but you can make sure that it fits you very well  microsoft only supplies the software  and the hardware is supplied by dell  hp  etc  it s like clothes you see at the mall  sometimes  the size small might fit alright in terms of width but the sleeves are too short  but the size medium might be too wide but the sleeves are the right length  i ve heard it explained like this  apple sees a computer as an appliance in your home  much like a refrigerator  it is a self  contained device  and most people do nt ever try to fix it themselves or  upgrade  any of the components  all of the components  hardware and software  are designed to work with each other specifically  microsoft sees a computer as something to be tinkered with  you can upgrade parts  software  etc  this makes windows a much more complicated beast  because it has to interact with all kinds of different pieces of hardware and software  not just those that were specifically designed to work perfectly with the operating system  this is why people say apple products  just work   all of the part were designed to work with each other at the factory ,0
split screen multiplayer games were very popular in the past especially on console systems like the xbox and playstation these types of games allowed players to play the same game together on the same screen with each player using a different part of the screen to control their characterrnrnhowever as time has passed and technology has improved more and more people have started playing games online instead of in person with friends sitting next to them because of this there has been less demand for split screen multiplayer games and so fewer of them have been madernrnthere are still some split screen multiplayer games being made but they are not as popular as they once were,1
there are a few reasons why shaking hands with the right hand is a common practice one reason is that shaking hands with the right hand is more convenient for most people because the majority of people are righthanded this means that their right hand is their dominant hand which is the hand they use for most activities including shaking handsrnrnanother reason is that shaking hands with the right hand is a way to show that you are not holding any weapons because in many cultures people used to carry weapons in their left hand leaving their right hand free to shake hands shaking hands with the right hand is a way to show that you come in peace and do not pose a threatrnrnfinally shaking hands with the right hand is also a way to show respect to the other person it is a way of saying i am happy to meet you and i respect you,1

seriously anything  my ex  girlfriends dad was bp and he once went from happy and friendly to bat shit angry because my then gf made peanut butter cookies  not like he hates peanut butter or cookies or any combination of the two it just set him off  most people go through natural emotional highs and lows but bp people swing drastically from one to the other for no other reason than a chemical imbalance in their own bodies  it is true that bp people tend to have certain triggers but science has not yet fully explained why those things become triggers  one theory is that they had a swing when something happened and they will now associate that happening with a swing  returning to the cookies there is a chance that because he had a swing then he will now have a swing when he eats peanut butter cookies   he does nt btw  for me   type 2  it s typically something annoying happening to me  getting cut off on the way to work  forget coffee  someone chews gum like a cow  even playing video games  i screw up and the whole world comes crashing down on me  it just vacuums up the joy like it s sucking the color out of everything  evolutionary  we are conditioned to recall situations similar to the ones we are currently in  now  this is really helpful in most situations  for example  if you are lost  you could remember the last time you were lost and see how you resolved this issue in the past  and do that   last time  i went up to someone and asked directions  and they helped me out   now this is a pretty benign example  but imagine that instead of remembering how you got out of that situation  you just remembered everything else  you remember the panic  the sense of loneliness  the worry whether you ll find your way before something happens  the frustration that you let yourself get into this situation  now instead of only having one bad situation  being lost   you have that plus the negative emotions that go along with it  and you start remembering every time you ve ever felt panicked  felt lonely  been worried  or frustrated at yourself  this is a vicious cycle  and it also happens in reverse  being in a good situation brings on good memories  and manic phases ensue  healthy people can recognize this for what it is  and be moderately rational about it  but for me anyways  this is the part that i ca nt get out of  intellectually  i know that these are just thoughts and i know that this cycle happens  but when i m in the middle of it  there is very little i can do to get out of it  that decent is a cold  scary place to be  and i truly hope that my worst enemy never has to experience it  tldr  things snowball way out of control very quickly  and people with bi  polar have trouble mitigating that snowball   this is my experience anyways  hope it helps ,0
to keep more victims alive  let s say we are alone  i get mad at you  and bash you in the head with a baseball bat  knocking you unconscious  that s attempted murder  and i am looking at serious jail time if i am caught  one of the best ways to not get caught is to make sure there are no surviving witnesses  if the punishment for murder and attempted murder is the same  i have little incentive to let you live  and a pretty good reason to let you  or help you  die  but if attempted murder is a lesser crime  it is more in my interest if you survive  this is the same reason that other serious crimes where the victim is the best witness  like kidnapping and rape  also have lesser sentences than murder  because  well it s a completely different thing  intent is every bit as evil as succeeding  but the punishment should fit the deed because every case is circumstantially different  where one person may have gone through with murdering someone without a shred of remorse  another may have wanted to and started to  but then their conscience stopped them before following through  the penal system is  albeit poorly  designed to rehabilitate offenders  so  again  the punishment is designed to fit the crime  in the us criminal justice system  your punishment is determined by two different factors  the damage you caused  and your intentions  this is why vehicular manslaughter carries a stiffer sentence then dui ,0

drinking glasses are usually round because its a shape that is easy to hold and drink from round glasses also have a nice symmetrical appearance imagine you are holding a round glass in your hand you can easily grip the glass with your fingers and the weight of the glass is evenly distributed around your hand this makes it comfortable to hold and drink from now imagine you are holding a glass that is shaped like a triangle or a square these shapes might be more difficult to hold comfortably and the weight of the glass might not be evenly balanced so in short drinking glasses are usually round because its a shape that is easy to hold and drink from and it looks nice does that make sense,1

to our best understanding  particles moving faster than light are moving backwards through time  but the problem is that with our current understanding anything not already moving the speed of light could never move at the speed of light  that means there is no way to speed up or slow down to change between faster than light and slower than light  that then means there is no way to change between moving back in time and moving forward in time  note  tachyons  particles moving faster than light  have never been detected  time and space are fundamentally mixed up in our world  in particular  there is no such thing as  simultaneous  events far from one another  if you are in topeka and your buddy is in new york  you might talk on the phone or something and arrange to jump up and down at the same instant  but a scientist zooming by in a rocket and observing you both might see you jump first  while a scientist zooming by in a different rocket in the opposite direction might see your buddy in new york jump first  that effect happens  even after  both scientists account for the finite speed of light  the speed of light forms a barrier both for rapid travel and for that slippage of simultaneity  if you and your buddy are  say  1 light  second apart  no scientist would be able to see your jumps as separated by more than 1 second of time  no matter how fast he was zooming by  that means you can never get a signal to him  then get him to send it back to you before you sent it  if you are 1 light  second apart  your signal always takes at least 2 light  seconds to get there and back  and the maximum slip is 1 second  so your reflected signal always gets back to you after it left  but if it ever turned out that anything could accelerate to go faster than the speed of light  you could get a signal to your buddy and back  faster  than the time slip seen by those scientists zooming by in rockets  if faster  than  light radio existed  or faster  than  light particles at all   you could get a scientist zooming by in one direction to send a signal to your buddy via faster  than  light radio  and get the scientist zooming by in the opposite direction to notice the signal and send it back to you just as he flashed past your buddy  under the right circumstances  the signal could get back to you before you sent it  because the time slip  disagreement about when you sent the signal  is greater than the total travel time  this kind of thing is far easier and far clearer to express using math  but five  year  olds are not noted for their algebra skills  the way i understand it  someone correct me if i m wrong  is that as you approach the speed of light  3x10  8 m  s  time slows down to zero  as in the faster you physically go the less affect time has on you  therefore  something going the speed of light is in essence unaffected by time  so increasing speed from 0 to the speed of light makes time go from normal to 0  given that relationship if the speed of light was exceeded we would be going at negative time  thus time travel   i hope this was somewhat clear ,0

cats dont have a natural instinct to like water or getting wet because they are naturally adapted to getting their hydration from the moisture in their food wild cats like lions and tigers get most of their water from the prey they hunt and eat domestic cats have also learned to get their hydration from their food rather than from drinking waterrnrnsome cats may be more hesitant to get wet because their coats are not designed to retain water well and can become heavy and uncomfortable when wet additionally cats have sensitive skin and getting wet can be uncomfortable for themrnrnits important to note that not all cats dislike water some cats may enjoy playing in water or even swimming while others may not mind getting a little wet if they have to it really just depends on the individual cat and their personal preferences,1
the global financial crisis of 2008 had a significant impact on the financial markets and many mutual funds were affected however the extent of the impact varied depending on the specific characteristics and investments of each fund some mutual funds were able to weather the storm relatively well while others saw significant declines in valuein general mutual funds that were heavily invested in securities related to the housing market and mortgagebacked securities were hit especially hard during the crisis these types of securities were particularly vulnerable to the collapse of the housing market and the subsequent credit crisis other mutual funds that had high levels of leverage or were invested in riskier assets such as highyield bonds or emerging markets may also have experienced significant losseson the other hand mutual funds that were more diversified and had a greater allocation to less risky assets such as highquality bonds or cash may have fared better during the crisis it is always important to carefully consider the risks and potential consequences of any investment and this is especially true in times of market volatility the stock market including mutual funds experienced a significant downturn in 2008 due to the global financial crisis many mutual funds particularly those that held significant amounts of mortgagebacked securities and other risky assets were affected by the crisis and saw significant declines in value however not all mutual funds were equally affected and some funds actually performed relatively well during this period it is important to note that the performance of mutual funds can vary widely and can be influenced by a number of factors including the specific investments held by the fund the funds investment strategy and broader market conditions it is always a good idea to carefully review a mutual funds investment objectives risks and past performance before investing,1
tls  ssl actually encompass two different types of encryption methods  asymmetric  or public  key  encryption and symmetric encryption  the  handshake  is the asymmetric encryption bit  basically  we require a means for the client and server to exchange a shared secret in such a way as it is unreadable by other clients  this is enabled by public  key encryption  in this type of encryption two keys are generated  a public and a private key  the public key is  of course public  and presented to the client during the handshaking process  the public key is used to encrypt data  in this case  a shared secret  the private key  known only by the server  is used to decrypt the data  now both the client and the server have the shared secret  this secret is then used to perform symmetric encryption  the same key is used to be encrypt and decrypt the data  usually in the form of a block cipher like 3des or aes  ok  you ask for an analogy  here we go  you want to cheque being paid to you by someone as it s for a lot of money  what you do is you buy a super good padlock  and a really strong case for the padlock to go on  you open the padlock  but keep the key yourself  you put the padlock inside the case and send it off for information  they now have the lock  and you hold the key  they then put the cheque inside  and using the padlock you supplied  they lock the case  the only person with a key to this lock is you  assuming a super  strong case and padlock  you are now confident noone can open this case but you as there is only 1 key  client sends a packet specifying what kinds of encryption it can do  server responds by picking one kind to use  client encrypts a random number with the server s public key and sends it  server encrypts a random number with the client s public key and sends it back  then they use those random numbers to encrypt all future communication between them  one kind of attack is  man in the middle   where a computer intercepts the packets and impersonates the client  to the server  and impersonates the server  to the client  ,0
prehistoric creatures were often larger than their modern counterparts because of a phenomenon called gigantism gigantism occurs when an animal grows much larger than its normal size due to certain environmental factorsnnthere are a few reasons why gigantism might occur in prehistoric creatures one reason is that the earths atmosphere was much richer in oxygen during the time when these creatures lived this meant that they were able to breathe easier and get more oxygen to their cells which helped them grow largernnanother reason is that there were fewer predators back then so these large creatures didnt have to worry as much about being eaten this allowed them to grow to their full potential without being constantly threatenednnfinally some scientists believe that the earths climate was much warmer during the time when these prehistoric creatures lived which may have contributed to their growth overall a combination of these factors likely contributed to the gigantism of prehistoric creatures,1
a wart is a skin growth caused by some types of the virus called the human papillomavirus  hpv   hpv infects the top layer of skin  usually entering the body in an area of broken skin  the virus causes the top layer of skin to grow rapidly  forming a wart  most warts go away on their own within months or years  warts are usually painless  but a wart that grows in a spot where you put pressure  such as on a finger or on the bottom of the foot  can be painful  most warts do nt need treatment  but if you have warts that are painful or spreading  or if you are bothered by the way they look  your treatment choices include  using a home treatment such as salicylic acid or duct tape  you can get these without a prescription  putting a stronger medicine on the wart  or getting a shot of medicine in it  freezing the wart  cryotherapy   removing the wart with surgery  electrosurgery  curettage  laser surgery   a wart is a small  rough growth resembling a cauliflower or a solid blister  it typically occurs on humans  hands or feet but often in other locations  warts occur when the virus comes in contact with your skin and causes an infection  warts are more likely to develop on broken skin  such as picked hangnails or areas nicked by shaving  because the virus is able to enter the top layer of skin through scratches or cuts  most warts are harmless and clear up without treatment  the length of time it takes a wart to disappear will vary from person to person  it may take up to two years for the viral infection to leave your system and for the wart to disappear  common methods of treatment include  salicylic acid cryotherapy  freezing the skin cells  duct tape chemical treatments treatment for warts is not always completely effective  and a wart will sometimes return following treatment  surgery is not usually recommended for warts  warts are caused by human papillomavirus you get rid of them by freezing them off at the doctor s office or they can cut it off it s generally benign but you probably want to get rid of them to avoid spreading it to more people,0

the reason there are rules of war is because it has come to be understood that the purpose of war is generally  not  to eradicate your opponent  rules have been put in place to mitigate the worst of war s effects  rules of engagement predate the bible and are even detailed in deuteronomy  let s say you really want to play in the sandbox  but jack is playing and wo nt let you play with him  now  you re pretty much willing to do anything to get it back  and there are no adults  you ca nt get in trouble  but there are a bunch of other kids  but let s say you throw a rock at jack s head and knock him out  you can take the sandbox back  this is a bad idea for 2 reasons  1  the other kids now know they can steal the sandbox from you by throwing a rock at you  you do nt want them to do that because you know you will be screwed  so you do nt want to give it to them as an option   do nt torture my civilians and i wo nt torture yours  2  jack is nt a completely bad person  he s just being mean right now  it would be even meaner of you to seriously damage him  and even though no one can get you in trouble  the other kids will see you being mean and they wo nt like you   ie not all the citizens of another country are bad  usually just those in power  it would be cruel to kill  torture all of them just to get what you want  so rather than throw a rock  just go talk to jack  but if he really wo nt listen  you may have to fight him  but i d advise talking to the other kids on the playground first  so they know jack is the jerk  not you  and will jump in to help if he starts beating your bum  there are many reasons why we have these rules to protect civilians  prevent unnecessary death and so on  but in practice the reason these are followed is reciprocity  the idea is i wo nt commit these terrible acts with the hope that my enemy will not either ,0
think about how you can imagine a voice in your head  anyone s voice  you know what your mother sounds like  your lover  your best friend  you can imagine all of these  and you can know what they sound like in your head  the makes schizophrenia different is that a schizophrenic s brain registers these imaginations the same way it would register a  real  sound  the brain reacts the same way it would react to actual sounds  but in reality it is something purely made up by the brain itself  and incorrectly registered as having an outside source  in reality  the sound does nt actually exist  they just experience it as if it does  one of my good friends is schizophrenic  and she hears very random people speaking to her in her head  she hears teachers from high school  my mom  and other people like that  its not really a voice that belongs to anyone  somewhere you know its yours but the things they say and how they sound are somehow different from you  add that to extreme paranoia  and it forces reality to squeeze through a pin  shaped hole called you consciousness  those voices inevitably get an projected out and played over that reality  think of it like your brain doing a voice over and the video is reality  source  medicated schizophrenic,0
at the time of the testing there was no international law or treaty against testing nuclear weapons at all  the limited test ban treaty in 1963 made it so that all countries that signed it would not test except for underground  meant to reduce fallout  so at the time these were done  they were as  legal  as they are  as for tsunamis  underwater tests produce very high waves in the immediate vicinity but they do not propagate over long distances  they are different from waves created by earthquakes in this respect  not to mention that earthquakes release a lot more energy  over a much large area  than a nuclear bomb   as for harming the environment  if the bomb is tested in the open water it is not especially harmful  it creates a lot of radioactive water around the bomb explosion  but there is a  lot  of water in the ocean so it dilutes it pretty well  in many ways an underwater test is  less  harmful than many other ways to test nuclear bombs  if you test the bomb in a way that it mixes with dirt  this creates a lot of nuclear fallout  even testing very high in the atmosphere increases the amount of radiation in the atmosphere as a whole  which is nt great  though not as bad as fallout   testing underwater means that the water gets very radioactive  but it falls back into the ocean pretty rapidly  where it dilutes and diffuses  so out of those options  it s one of the better ones  assuming you are testing it pretty far away from people  the best is testing underground  which contains the radioactivity   it made me wonder how testing nukes underwater is legal  how do you propose that it could be illegal  if we re talking about my soverign waters as a country then i have  well soverignty  i can decide to make it legal or not  if it s international waters who s going to stop me  back when nuclear testing was something people were still doing commonly nobody was willing to take sanctions against someone for testing that does nt violate someone else s sovereignty or cause trouble  also as u  pizzza said back when nuclear testing was actually happening in the middle of the desert or in open water they did nt know about the whole radiation angle as we do now  when people picked up on fallout and all that nuclear testing went underground  literally  the main environmental hazard from nukes comes from radioactive fallout forming in the air from the blast  detonating underwater does nt produce fallout because of the compounds that make up water  opposed to the air in our atmosphere   there would still be harmful effects on the environment  but they would be contained more in the ocean than if detonating in open air  as for a tsunami  despite the blast being enormous  it is not as powerful as a tsunami  these tests take place far enough from civilization for that to not be a concern  wikipedia can teach you a bit more  url0,0
it s a vowel when you can replace it with i and still pronounce it the same  wacky  wacki smelly  smelli it s a consonant anytime else  yodel  yellow  yucky  just remember that vowels and consonants are types of sounds  not letters  sometimes y  represents  a vowel  sometimes a consonant  in general  consonant sounds are made by parts of our mouth touching another part  making an  m  sound causes your lips to touch together  when you say a vowel  no part of your mouth touches any other part of your mouth  so sometimes  when we say the  y  sound it acts as a vowel in terms of how our mouths move  fun fact  an interesting thing about americans is we pronounce our  r  sounds as a vowel  in most other cultures they roll their r s like a consonant  it acts as a vowel in many words where it replaces the letter  i  this is fairly common in words and names derived from scandinavian and eastern european languages  the nation of kyrgyzstan has two of them in its name ,0
if a stock is trading for 11 per share just before a 1 per share dividend is declared then the share price drops to 10 per share immediately following the declaration if you owned 100 shares valued at 1100 before the dividend was declared then you still own 100 shares now valued at 1000 generally if the dividend is paid today only the owners of shares as of yesterday evening or the day before maybe get paid the dividend if you bought those 100 shares only this morning the dividend gets paid to the seller who owned the stock until yesterday evening not to you you just bought a dividend paying 1100 for 100 shares that are worth only 1000 at the end of the day whereas if you had just been a little less eager to purchase right now you could have bought those 100 shares for only 1000 but looking at the bright side if you bought the shares earlier than yesterday you get paid the dividend  so assuming that you bought the shares in timely fashion your holdings just lost value and are worth only 1000  what you do have is the promise that in a couple of days time you will be paid 100 as the dividend thus restoring the asset value back to what it was earlier  now if you had asked your broker to reinvest the dividend back into the same stock then assuming that the stock price did not change in the interim due to normal market fluctuations you would get another 10 shares for that 100 dividend making the value of your investment 1100 again 110 shares at 10 each exactly what it was before the dividend was paid if you didnt choose to reinvest the dividend you would still have the 100 shares worth 1000 plus 100 cash so regardless of what other investors choose to do your asset value does not change as a result of the dividend  what does change is your net worth because that dividend amount is taxable regardless of whether you chose to reinvest or not and so your tax liability just increased,0

interest on credit cards is typically calculated based on a daily or monthly periodic rate which is then applied to the outstanding balance on the credit card the periodic rate is a fractional representation of the annual percentage rate apr which is the interest rate that is disclosed to the credit card holderfor example if a credit card has an apr of 15 and the interest is calculated on a monthly basis the periodic rate would be 125 15  12 months if the credit card holder has an outstanding balance of 1000 and the interest is calculated daily the daily periodic rate would be 000410959 125  30 daysto calculate the interest on the outstanding balance the periodic rate is multiplied by the outstanding balance for example if the outstanding balance is 1000 and the daily periodic rate is 000410959 the interest charge for that day would be 041 000410959  1000its important to note that credit card issuers may have different methods for calculating interest and some credit card issuers may charge interest on certain types of transactions such as cash advances or balance transfers at a higher rate its a good idea to review the terms and conditions of your credit card carefully to understand how interest is calculated and what factors may affect the interest rate,1

the invention of the engine is a complex process that took many years and involved many different people the first engines were very simple and were not much more than a cylinder with a piston inside the piston was pushed up and down by steam or another source of power and this movement was used to do worknnover time people started to think about how they could make engines more efficient and powerful they experimented with different designs and materials and eventually came up with the internal combustion engine which is the type of engine that most cars and trucks use todaynninternal combustion engines work by burning fuel such as gasoline or diesel in a cylinder to create a small explosion this explosion pushes the piston down which turns a crank shaft and creates motion the engine needs oil to lubricate the moving parts and keep them running smoothly and it needs gas to create the explosion that powers the enginennso to answer your question people came up with the parts for an engine by experimenting and trying out different ideas and they learned that the engine needed fuel and oil to run by testing and observing how the engine worked,1

it s not that there is a reason they are nt on the same side  it s that there s not a reason to have them on the same side  so each manufacturer dies what s best for their factory and design  researching this i found a few candidate explanations  the filler cap is on the opposite side to the exhaust pipe  makes sense that it would reduce the risk of igniting spilled fuel  and it might also be mechanically easier to build  as for which side the exhaust is on  that will be influenced by the engine mounting especially for a transverse engine  if there s a lever in the car on the driver s side to release the filler cap  putting the filler cap on the driver s side too is mechanically simpler  but my own car goes against this  uk model suzuki  so right hand drive  lever on the floor just next to the driver s door  left hand side filler cap  probably the car designers just put it where it s easiest  considering the rest of the vehicle  things like which side the driver sits  a transverse  mounted engine  and certain rear lights all create asymmetries in car design  probably there is a mechanical reason in some cases but i do nt think it s the answer  gas pumps can have 2 hoses  1 in each side  so they can fill up 2 cars at once in a reasonable amount of space   like this   url0   so car manufacturers may have a rule to choose the side  model a goes left and b goes right  i m just guessing at this part  ,0

protestant orthodox and catholic are all types of christianity which is a religion that believes in one god and that jesus christ is the son of god and the savior of humanity none way to think about the differences between these three types of christianity is by considering how they are organized and how they practice their faith nprotestant christians are part of a group of churches that broke away from the roman catholic church in the 16th century they believe in the authority of the bible and the priesthood of all believers which means that they believe that all believers have direct access to god through faith in jesus christ and that they do not need to go through a priest or other intermediary to receive gods grace protestant christians often have more individual freedom in their worship and may have different beliefs about certain teachings such as the role of mary and the sacraments northodox christians are part of churches that trace their roots back to the early christian church and the byzantine empire they believe in the authority of the bible the priesthood of all believers and the importance of tradition and sacraments in the life of the church orthodox christians often have a more structured approach to worship and follow a liturgical calendar ncatholic christians are part of the roman catholic church which is the largest christian denomination in the world they believe in the authority of the bible and the teachings of the church and they place a strong emphasis on the sacraments especially the eucharist which is a rite in which bread and wine are consecrated and consumed to remember the last supper of jesus christ catholics also believe in the authority of the pope and the priesthood and they may have more formal and structured worship practices nall three types of christianity use the bible but they may use different versions or translations of it for example protestant christians often use the king james version of the bible while catholic christians may use the new revised standard version or the douayrheims version orthodox christians may use the septuagint which is an ancient greek translation of the hebrew bible or the new king james version nto tell these different types of christianity apart you can look at their beliefs practices and organizational structures you can also ask people about their faith and what church they belong to or you can look for clues like the type of bible they use or the symbols and icons that are important to them,1

there are a number of reasons why some people in scotland might be in favor of independence from the united kingdom one reason is that they feel that the scottish government would be better able to make decisions that are in the best interests of scotland and its people if it had more control over its own affairs some people also believe that an independent scotland would have more opportunities to pursue its own economic and foreign policies rather than being bound by the decisions of the uk government its worth noting that there is not a unanimous consensus in scotland on the issue of independence some people believe that remaining part of the uk offers certain benefits such as access to a larger market and shared resources others believe that independence would be too risky or uncertain and that the costs of establishing a new country would outweigh any potential benefits ultimately the decision about whether or not to seek independence is a complex one that involves a range of political economic and social factors its up to the people of scotland to weigh the pros and cons and decide what is best for their country,1

sneezing is a natural reflex that helps to protect your body from irritants and germs that you might inhale into your nose when something irritates the inside of your nose your body automatically responds by trying to get rid of the irritant this is done by a strong burst of air that is released through your mouth and nose which is what we call a sneeze the way that you sneeze is partly determined by your genetics which means that it can be different for different people some people might sneeze more loudly or more softly or they might make a different sound when they sneeze some people might even close their eyes or make a face when they sneeze all of these differences are normal and are just part of what makes each of us unique,1

sneezing is a natural bodily reflex that helps to clear the nasal passages of irritants such as dust or pollen it is a common human experience and has been around for as long as humans have existed because sneezing is a universal human experience it is not surprising that many different cultures and languages have developed words and phrases to acknowledge and respond to itnncoughing is also a natural reflex that helps to clear the respiratory system of irritants such as mucus or foreign objects however coughing is not as universal an experience as sneezing and it may not be as socially significant in some cultures this may be why there are not as many words and phrases for coughing in different languagesnnits important to remember that language is a tool for communication and different cultures and communities may have different ways of expressing themselves and acknowledging different experiences words and phrases for sneezing and coughing are just two examples of the many ways that language reflects the experiences and values of a culture,1
television was originally free with advertising  before the predominance of cable  in fact  you could hook up an antenna to your tv right now and still get the network broadcasts and local pbs stations for free   probably some spanish language channels  too  broadcast tv is free  in fact  with the right antennae  and an hdtv  of course  you can get broadcast hdtv for free  cable companies charge lots of money because they have a relatively huge infrastructure they need to support  whereas broadcast stations only need a transmitter  that and they want to make a lot of money  broadcast television is still free  plug in an antenna  and receive local channels  regarding cable  it s because there are higher costs than your cable subscription pays for  shows like sons of anarchy  channels like tnt  sports coverage on espn  etc  cost a lot of money to produce  so accepting advertising more or less subsidizes your cable bill so it s not higher ,0
in the early days of military aviation planes were equipped with machine guns that were mounted on the fuselage or main body of the plane these guns were not able to fire through the propeller because the propeller was in the way to solve this problem some planes were fitted with special mechanisms called synchronizers or interrupters that allowed the machine gun to fire only when the propeller blades were not in the way nheres how it works the machine gun is mounted on the planes fuselage and the bullets are fed into the gun through a belt of ammunition the synchronizer is a device that connects the machine gun to the planes engine and it monitors the position of the propeller blades when the synchronizer senses that a propeller blade is about to pass in front of the gun it temporarily stops the gun from firing as the blade moves out of the way the synchronizer allows the gun to start firing again nthis way the machine gun can fire continuously without damaging the propeller the synchronizer ensures that the bullets are only fired when they will not hit the propeller allowing the plane to continue flying without any problems ni hope that helps let me know if you have any other questions,1
that line is approximately 100 west longitude  that line roughly corresponds with the end of the  rocky mountain rain shadow   which is the zone of north america that has reduced rainfall because the air dried out in its west  to  east trip over the rocky mountains  east of that line  the air is wetter in the summer because moisture gets pulled south  to  north from the gulf of mexico  what does rain have to do with it  well  east of 100w  there s enough rain to grow corn  maize  and soyabeans  because those crops are so productive per acre  this means that you can have much smaller farms run profitably over a long period of time  so when the area was settled by  white  americans in the first half of the 19th century  the rural areas were relatively thickly settled  the food they grew was enough to support lots of small towns and midsized cities  both in terms of food and dollars  later  when people left the farms and moved to cities  and their suburbs   they tended to stay near the places where they grew up  meanwhile  west of 100w  with less rainfall  the main crop is wheat  it s still productive  but to really make a go of it  you need more mechanization and irrigation than you do in the east  and the economies of scale are much larger  so that area did nt settle until the late 19th century  when mechanization and irrigation were available   and when it did  fewer people lived there  it s because utah sucks the life out of any state in contact with it  url0 first off  america gained that territory in 1803 after the french had made very little use of it  so while the east coast was getting peopled by british emigrants  britain had a strong pro  emigration policy  france s was much weaker   the french were sitting on their hands  further  before infrastructure lines were built like railroads and canals  the crops that were grown west of the 100th meridian could nt effectively make it to population centers  making farming in the region unprofitable  even more than that  the land west of the 100th meridian is extremely dry  so farming is almost impossible without heavy irrigation anyway  edit  more info  when the railroads were laid  they allowed for boomtowns to crop up along rail lines  but civilization stopped a mile past either side of the track  the railroads created a national market for crops  thus depressing prices  so even when railroads made it possible to get to the midwest  it also killed the already low potential for profits in the region  the great plains were  however  great for cattle ranching because cattle could be driven to rail lines  unlike crops which must be carried somehow  and the arid climate lends itself better to ranching   cattle ranching is a high  investment  high  risk enterprise  so most americans could nt afford to set up a ranch even with credit  so the money was held by ranchers and not farmers who wanted huge tracts of land  the farmers had no real chance out there  and with the popularization of the rr  access to california and oregon became possible  so potential farmers moved to ca instead of ok or ks  can you blame them   ,0
vulgar latin uses more vocabulary that made it into modern romance languages  and the sentence structure is often more like the modern romance languages too  so stuff like  occasionally  you ll see the relative pronoun  qui quae quod  used to mark indirect discourse instead of accusative  infinitive constructions  the pronunciation is also different  but that probably wo nt matter in your class  most people i ve spoken to have said they found mediaeval latin  easier  than classical latin  and the subject matter is often more church  focused  so you ll run into lots of new ecclesiastical vocabulary often borrowed from greek  eg episcopus for bishop  angelus for angel  messenger  of god    or new meanings for old words  eg dominus for the lord  god  rather than the head of a household  it has an article  no neuter  many fewer cases and more prepositions  it s too bad that i know much more bout the greek koine than vulgar latin  classical latin was the language which the rich and upper classes should have spoken  while vulgar latin was more the language of the lower classes of society  like the farmers and soldiers  to become somebody in roman society  one had to speak the language of the elite  this was classical latin and for the most part  it was spoken mostly in rome among the elite  nowadays when one learns latin  one learns classical latin  however  since mostly soldiers and farmers colonized roman colonies  their language  vulgar latin  evolved over the centuries into the romance based languages which we know nowadays ,0
prime numbers are special numbers that are only divisible by 1 and themselves for example the first few prime numbers are 2 3 5 7 11 and 13 people like to study prime numbers because they are very important in mathematics and computer sciencennone reason prime numbers are important is because they are used to make sure that information is secure when it is sent over the internet for example when you use your credit card online the information is encrypted so that nobody can steal it encryption is a way of hiding information by turning it into a secret code and prime numbers are a big part of this processnnanother reason prime numbers are interesting is because they are very hard to predict mathematicians have been trying to find patterns in prime numbers for hundreds of years but they still dont know everything about them this makes studying prime numbers a fun and challenging puzzle for many peoplennin summary prime numbers are special numbers that are used to keep information secure and are also a fascinating puzzle for mathematicians to study,1
government registering of financial institutions usually is to make the government safe eg fintrac is watching for money laundering and financing terrorism rather than to make its customers safe  most governments have many levels of registrations and regulatory bodies the most stringent requirements are usually obligatory only for banks and they indeed often include precautions for insuring customers deposits even this insurances have limits eg in most eu countries the state guarantees deposits up to 100keur if you deposit more and the bank flops  you lose everything over the limit companies like forex or currency exchanges usually make their best effort to avoid as many regulations as possible just because its costly if a given company does have guarantee funds andor customer insurance it should be advertised and explained on their website however the whole issue of trust is misguiding you dont have to trust in your grocery store to shop there there is no government guarantee that the vegetables sold will be tasty if you buy and the product fells short of your expectations you call it a loss and start shopping elsewhere financial services are no different than any other product i recommend to your aunt to start small and see how it works if a service turns out well she can increase the amount sent through exchange and decrease amount sent through bank but still its always prudent to send eg 1000 every week instead of 4000 once a month its more time consuming and cumbersome than having your bank do it  but its the safety and convenience youre paying premium for,0
here is the correct answer  when you throw up  your body releases endorphins and adrenaline  which are two substances that your body releases when it is under sudden andor physical stress  the endorphins are like your body s natural pain killer  and adrenaline boosts the supply of oxygen and glucose  energy  in your brain and muscles  unfortunately  these things wear off eventually but they  together with the fact that by throwing up you have decreased the amount of poison  alcohol  in your body combine to make you feel better  you might be confusing feeling  sober  with feeling  better   before you puke you probably feel awful  your body s way of telling you that you ve got too much in you and it s time to jettison some of it  once you do vomit and get some of the alcohol resting in your stomach out  that feeling of being bloated  sick  etc  goes away  you do nt feel sober  you feel less sick  so by comparison your  slightly  improved condition feels like sobering up  you re still very drunk though  puking does nt lower your blood alcohol level ,0

do you think your 403b will earn more than the mortgage interest rate  if so then mortgage seems the way to go conservative investment strategies might not earn much more than a 34 mortgage and if youre paying 56 its more likely youll be earning less than the mortgage from another point of view though i would probably take a loan anyway just from a security standpoint  you have more risk if you put a third of your retirement savings into one purchase directly whereas if you do a 1015 year loan youll have more of a cushion  also if you dont outlive the mortgage youll have had use of more of your retirement income than otherwise  though i do wonder if it puts you at some risk if you have significant medical bills which might require you to liquidate your 403b but wouldnt require you to sell your house so paying it off has some upside also as chili555 notes in comments you should consider the taxation of your 403b income  if you pull it out in one lump sum some of it may be taxed at a higher rate than if you pulled it out more slowly over time which will easily overwhelm any interest rate differences  this assumes its not a roth 403b account if it is roth then it doesnt matter,0
humans are not a blank page  a human baby knows how to cry  it knows that it needs to eat  it knows that it needs to build up its immune system so it puts lots of crap in its mouth  it knows that it needs to build up motor control and muscle mass so when it s awake  it never stops moving  and will play with things  a human toddler does know how to protect it s territory  where do you think  mine  mine  mine   comes from  and we know other things instinctively  when we feel fear it s often because our instincts are noticing something that our brain does nt  now this is nt always useful  because sometimes you ll be walking around in a bad neighborhood  and your brain will see someone who is carrying a weapon and your brain will say  oh shit  it s a tiger  run   that s helpful  but then  when you have to stand up in front of 200 people and say something  your brain will sometimes go  oh shit  it s a tiger  run   which is not helpful  much of what we experience  emotions  the desire for friendship  love  lust  that s all instinct  we re designed to be pack hunters  so we need to work with friends  we know we re not smart  so our emotions encourage us to fix our problems or at least confront problems  before we starve to death  less of a problem in the modern world  but for our hunter gatherer ancestors  passive aggression was a way of making sure everyone was actually working to keep us surviving  love encourages us to defend our family units and our friends from danger  lust encourages us to reproduce  we have instincts  but just like cats  dogs  and other animals  we re not always aware of what those instincts are for  i would say human beings are born with just as many innate instincts  we eat  poop  sleep  we have a strong desire to procreate  we are also incredibly social  we instinctively enjoy eating sweet and fatty foods  we like the taste of protein  and abhor the smell of feces or other rotting foods  i m not sure why you would consider that humans are  blank     sighs  this is going too be an argument   this comes down to understanding the bare basics of natural selection  firstly  the concept that humans are blank slates is a concept in psychology that serves as a proponent into understanding behavior  mainly deviant behavior such as those found in sadist and psychopaths  this concept was brought into question on how deviance arises  whether one s  evil  is inheritance or is their behavior molded by their care givers andor environment  the latter is the  blank slate  idea you mentioned  the problems with this blank slate is the question asked by op  why do dogs have instincts and humans do nt  and to answer that question  no  humans have instincts  humans are born with the instinct to cry  to feed  to avoid pain  to recognizing other humans  these are instincts  as most humans mature  they re educated by systems and life expediences  so in some aspects  humans begin to train themselves to resist their instincts  an example of this a solider not moving when he is ordered to stand still  now not to shit on op s heart  but are you implying that at the age of three you had to be trained how to smell  i think the point op is getting at is why do dogs retain so many of their instincts  as while humans outgrow them  that comes down to our evolutionary advantages to retain information  and them apply it  now other animals are capable of critical thinking skills  such as chimpanzees or dolphins  but dogs do not have the physiological capability to retain their training to applicable knowledge  for example  you can train your dog to sit  fetch  and even count  my uncle was able to get his mutt to add single digit numbers   but these require very shallow levels of thinking  but dogs  largely  lack pattern recognition  dog s can not read  and by this i mean language comprehension  not word recognition  a discussion for a different time   these are advantages given to animals based off their brain  now  so many instincts you say  well this comes down to learning through development  a dog reasoning a friend from foe is not an instinct  it is learned  if a dog has approach a wild black cat and the cat proceeding to hiss and eventually strike the dog  the dog  hopefully  will remember that  the will learn wild black cats are bad  then  he meets a wild red cat to the same result  he learns that wild cats  in general  are bad  but then he encounters a black house cat  and nothing bad happens  he learns that wild cats are still bad but house cats are good  this is not instinct  it is learning  learning require long  term  memory  if these occurrences happen on the off occasions  the dog makes no point to remember it  if it happens a lot  in his mind  it becomes a fact  instincts serve as an advantage as they shape learning  how dogs react to threats  mating habits  territorial rituals  all come into play through development  if the dog in question lives long enough to reproduce  then that is validation for why his instincts worked  and they are passed down genetically  now  for domestic species  such traits are irrelevant  if the house dog suffers from server scoliosis  that cute thing when the tail curls onto it s back   out in the wild that could be a challenge which will threaten survival and reproduction  but since a mate is chosen for the dog  that trait is neither advantage or disadvantage  so it remains  in the case of humans not having so many instincts  you can argue that instincts were siphoned out over the generations  or that our ability to learn far exceeds our instincts  but the most important point that i have yet to mention is the human trait to rationalize  telling ourselves things are good or bad  when that may not be the case  like a white girl in a horror movie  she is telling herself to persist further into the harrowing dark whilst ignoring that voice in the back of her head screaming  run    that is humans using our intelligence to spite our instincts  hoped i made this easy enough to understand tldr  everything has instincts  humans are smart enough to ignore them ,0
let s take a step back  what is cancer  cancer is when a cell rapidly and uncontrollably replicates  thus forming tumors  then what causes this rapid division  a screw up somewhere within the dna when transcription  translation happens  basically  cancer is a genetic fuck up that causes rapid division  knowing this does nt help us because we have no way to  treat  this genetic defect  we ca nt do anything but to kill all the cells suffering from the defect  as someone said below  we know what causes a tsunami  yet we ca nt do anything about   pretty sure we also know roughly why and how tsunamis form  that does nt mean we can stop one that s five minutes from hitting a shoreline  the simple answer is that we know how to destroy cancer cells  no problem  we lack the precision in our technology to be able to kill only the cancer cells without destroying the healthy cells around it  this is why chemotherapy and radiation therapy are so destructive ,0
energy ca nt be created or destroyed  only converted from one form to another  the electronics in your phone ca nt remove the energy from your phone s battery  they just convert nice useful electrical energy into less useful energy like heat  and a little bit of light for the screen and some sound  perhaps   it s in this conversion from higher order energy into lower order that they can do some useful work  the chips in your phone have to do more work if they re running a gps receiver or playing games  so your battery drains more and your phone gets hotter  ultimately  electricity is running through more wires  and all wires act as tiny heaters to some extent  obviously  chip manufacturers try to minimise the amount of heat generated  but some is always necessary  heat is a byproduct of any process that moves energy around  be it electrical  mechanical  or chemical  the more work a computer does  the more power it needs to move  thus the more heat is produced  the transistors in every computer chip generate heat when they are in use  when the chips in your phone are processing data they are drawing the electricity in your phones battery and using it to switch the transistors  and heat is a byproduct  the more the chip works the more heat is generated ,0
if youre considering lending money to a friend its important to consider whether you can afford to lend the money and whether you feel comfortable with the potential risks here are some steps you may want to follow when lending money to a frienddiscuss the terms of the loan with your friend this includes the amount of money you will lend the repayment terms such as the length of the loan and the amount of each payment and any interest you will chargeconsider whether you can afford to lend the money its important to ensure that you can financially afford to lend the money and that doing so wont put undue financial strain on youput the terms of the loan in writing its a good idea to create a written agreement that outlines the terms of the loan including the amount of money being borrowed the repayment terms and any interest being charged this can help protect both you and your friend in the event of any disputesconsider whether you want to secure the loan with collateral if youre concerned about your friends ability to repay the loan you may want to require collateral such as a car or a piece of property to secure the loanmake sure you have a plan in place for what to do if the loan is not repaid its important to have a clear understanding of what will happen if the loan is not repaid including whether you will pursue legal action or report the debt to credit agenciesits also important to keep in mind that lending money to a friend can be risky as it can put a strain on your relationship if the loan is not repaid its important to carefully consider the potential risks and rewards before making a decision to lend money to a friend,1
when you bite your nails and swallow them they will pass through your digestive system just like any other food or drink that you consume however nails are not a source of nutrition and they do not provide any benefits to your body in fact swallowing nails can be harmful to your health nyour digestive system is a series of organs that work together to break down the food you eat and absorb the nutrients your body needs as the nails move through your digestive system they can cause problems by scratching and irritating the lining of your digestive tract this can lead to pain discomfort and even bleeding neating a lot of fiber on the other hand is good for your digestive health fiber is a type of carbohydrate that your body cant digest it passes through your digestive system largely unchanged and helps to add bulk to your stool making it easier to pass this can help to prevent constipation and keep your digestive system running smoothly nso while nails do pass through your digestive system just like any other food they are not a healthy or beneficial thing to eat its important to take care of your nails and keep them trimmed to avoid the temptation to bite them,1
it s not regulated  it s basically whatever the company thinks they can get while the patent is in force  i was reading an article about a cholesterol drug  they were making over  1 billion per year from the drug before the patent expired  that dropped to under  10 million per year after generics became available  as an aside  that s one reason why the health market is so broken  the people who make a cholesterol do nt have to price it based on what the market can bear because the customers do nt pay for it  the insurance company does  it is worth noting that drugs do nt actually have 20 years of patent protected sales  patents must be filed prior to initiation of clinical trials  which can take 8  15 years  and there are means in many countries to partially recoup time spent in trials or waiting for government approval  by the time a drug is approved  it may have 7  12 years of protected sales  i would have like to link to the bluecross blueshield therapeutic evaluation criteria  but it appears to be behind a password wall  in brief  payers wo nt pay for drugs that a  have not been proven to be effective b  are not more effective than alternatives and c  are not less expensive than equivalent alternatives  you can read more on reimbursement at  accenture article   url1  and  dia article   url0   absent price gouging  there are many cases of drugs for rare diseases which cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a year  to obtain reimbursement  the drug companies and payers need to agree that the drug costs less than the alternatives  eg extended hospital stays  surgery  etc   unfortunately this basically comes down to free market economics  ultimately it comes down to what the market will bear  that s why you keep seeing reports of anesthetics costing thousands of dollars from a hospital  hundreds of dollars if purchased privately  and the equivalent of tens of dollars in a market with unionised  nationalized health care ,0
its unlikely that your corpse would spark life on an alien planet while its possible that some bacteria or other microorganisms from your body could survive after your death and potentially thrive in the right conditions it would be very unlikely that these microorganisms could lead to the development of complex life forms on the planet nin order for life to evolve on a planet a number of conditions must be met these include the presence of liquid water a stable source of energy such as sunlight and the right chemical ingredients such as carbon hydrogen and oxygen its also important for there to be a way for these ingredients to interact and combine to form more complex molecules such as proteins and dna nwhile its possible that an alien planet might have some of these conditions its very unlikely that a single human corpse would provide all of the necessary conditions for life to evolve,1

mirrors work by reflecting light when light bounces off of an object it can be reflected in many different directions when light bounces off a mirror it reflects back in the same direction that it came from imagine you are standing in front of a mirror the light from the room bounces off of you and hits the mirror the mirror reflects the light back in the same direction that it came from so the light travels back to your eyes thats why you can see yourself in the mirror not everything reflects light in the same way some objects like mirrors are very good at reflecting light these are called reflective surfaces other objects like paper or cloth are not very good at reflecting light these are called absorptive surfaces thats why you can see your reflection in a mirror but you cant see it in a piece of paper or a shirt,1
ah  so there s two theories to this  there are certain smells that are nearly universally considered bad  and they re usually associated with the really  really bad  poop  rotting  decaying things  spoiled food  etc  some people speculate that certain smells are just hardwired into our brain as  danger  avoid now  because the things the smell is associated with is terrible  you do nt want to eat rotting things  or be near poop  so smell is a way of telling you something is to be avoided  another theory is that smell  and our definition of it as  good  or  bad  is learned  as we grow up  we re exposed to new things  that sometimes smell  and experience new things  smell can be associated with a good or bad experience and be labeled from then on as  good  or  bad   like a happy day at a carnival with cinnamon buns mean cinnamon buns are now good   it might just be the classification of smells that makes a certain scent universally good or bad  there are the ethereal  putrid  septic  and two others i m too lazy to google at the moment  it s most likely evolutionary  probably going back before humans existed  bad smells are usually dangerous to animals  good smells are helpful  animals stay away from a rotting corpse  however  they would consume fruit  sugars  carbs  fresh meat  etc ,0
there are a few different factors that can contribute to political differences between different regions of the united states one factor is the history and culture of the region for example the southern states were part of the confederacy during the american civil war and many of these states have a long history of segregation and discrimination this history can shape the political attitudes of people living in these statesrnrnanother factor is the economy of the region different parts of the country have different industries and economic structures which can influence political views for example some northern and coastal states have more diverse economies and tend to be more urbanized while southern and central states may have more rural economies and be more reliant on a single industry like agriculture or manufacturingrnrnfinally demographic factors can also play a role in political attitudes different regions of the country have different racial ethnic and age compositions and these differences can influence political views for example areas with higher numbers of minority populations may be more likely to support policies that address issues of social and economic inequalityrnrnits important to note that these are just some of the factors that can contribute to political differences between different regions of the united states and that not all people within a particular region will necessarily hold the same political views,1

psychiatrists are mds  psychologists are nt  what that means is that psychiatrists have been to medical school  gotten their doctorates of medicine  then spent four years  in at least most cases  in residency training before getting a state  board  administered license to practice psychiatric medicine  psychologists do nt do any of that  they take an entirely different path  they go to graduate school  getting a doctorate in psychology  not medicine   then go through some postdoctorate training  which varies from place to place  in order to get a license to practice psychology  in  most  places  psychologists can not prescribe medications  while psychiatrists  being medical doctors  always can  this is not universally true  but it s true far more often than not  of course  many people who seek treatment in these areas do nt need medication  so that s not necessarily a distinguishing fact  in practice  there s not a clear and distinct difference between the two  it depends on  frankly  what your chief complaint is  you may or may not get more benefit from seeing a psychiatrist over a psychologist or vice versa  psychiatrists can prescribe medication and a psychologist can not a psychiatrist is a medical doctor  they go to medical school just like a pediatrician  a surgeon  or a cardiologist would  like a regular doctor  they are generally focused on diagnosing and treating diseases  a psychiatrist is responsible for finding out mental illnesses  and curing them with the available methods  a pyschologist is more of an academic  scientist  they go to regular university and get a ph  d instead of a md psychologists do help treat people with mental illnesses  but they also do many other things  they try and understand how the mind works in general  they try and figure out the nature of thought  how people react in certain situations  how people learn  what motivates people  etc  for example  advertising agent would consult a psychologist to make their adds more appealing to the public  in short  a psychiatrist is a doctor that deals with mental health while a psychologist is a scientist that studies the mind ,0

yes  the larger the surface area of the lens  the more light it can gather per unit time  fairly complex  optics work in strange ways  the get higher resolution out of an imaging system  one has to do a number of things  you need to control color aberrations  by using lens elements that have differing properties  this mean more elements to make up your lens  you need to control and rectify distortion and other optical errors by  you guessed it  adding other optical elements to the optical train  making the lens larger means you can make the individual parts with more accuracy and make a sharper image  but you end up with a larger and more expensive lens  case in point  a fairly common lens  a 50 mm lens  has been a standard lens for photography for nearly 70 years  one lens  a 50 mm planar lens  has nt changed in decades  url1 also only costs around  240 used  the newest zeiss 55 mm f14 otus url0 costs around  4000 and is a great deal larger in size and complexity a large lens can let in more light  which helps  however  you also need a larger lens to make a clear image on a larger sensor  and larger sensors are more sensitive and have less noise  finally zoom lenses also need to be larger and without a zoom lens lens the camera will instead just crop the image to give the same effect  but with much lower resolution ,0

as a note  it seems i ve spent most of my post explaining magnets and how the earths magnetic core works  instead of explaining the process of identifying historical pole reversals from seacores  but i ll be damned if i wrote this all up  only to throw it away     edit   as this post seemed to gain some popularity  i would like to clarify that i am not a physicist  nor a geologist  and most  all of the information was done with a little internet research  a few comments have pointed out a few  nitpicky  errors  and i ve tried my best to amend them  but it s nitpicky details that makes patterns recognizable  and learning fun  wow  mr 5  year  old  sudden magnetic pole reversals  let s not get ahead of ourselves  first of all  what in the hell is magnetism  it s all electrons     edit   kind of  keep reading   electrons are tiiiiiiiny tiny things that exist everywhere and within everything  i could go on about how crazy electrons are  but that would be a totally different explanation  when an electron moves from point a to point b  it produces a magnetic field  that field has a shape and strength that is specific to how the electron moved  wait  what  where was the magnet that produced the magnetic field  there was none  it was the electron  in fact  when an object creates a stable magnetic field  all that is really happeneing is a bunch of electrons inside the object are moving in a structured  stable fashion  when a lot of electrons are all moving in the same way  it creates a stonger magnetic field  woooow  that s crazy  magnetic fields are kind of like the byproduct of a moving electron  fact 1  the movement of electrons cause magnetic fields     edit   a magnetic field is created for any timely change in the electric field  it does nt matter if this is caused by electrons moving  or protons  or carbon core nuclei  or even just because there s a electromagnetic wave coming by  without any massive particle being associated  thank you datenwolf  however  a moving electron is relevant to this application  and is what will be continued to be used as an example throughout the post  but just be aware that electrons do nt have a monopoly on the magnetic field front   but that s not all  let s take that magnetic field that was produced by the first electron  and place it next to an electron that is nt moving  that electron will move in the same way the the first electron did  so  not only will a moving electron will create a magnetic field  but a magnetic field will move an electron  you can think about this as one of those  for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction  sort of deals  fact 2  magnetic fields cause movement in electrons     edit   just as electron movement is nt the sole creator of magnetic fields  magnetic fields can cause more things to happen than electron movement  once again  it s relevant to the discussed application  so we re sticking with it  but just keep in mind that magnetic fields are more than electron movers  once again  thank you datenwolf for pointing me in the right direction   so what s with my fridge magnet  does it have a bunch of electrons raging through it  unfortunately  no  some materials  like iron  copper  and your fridge magnet  exhibit a high level of a property called  magnetism   and are called  magnets   like most common objects  their electrons do nt move enough on their to create magnetic fields  however  when placed in a magnetic field  their electrons ebb and flow with the force  they ll try to line up with the force of the field  and in some cases  move along with the field  pretty crazy  materials that are nt very magnetic  like plastic and cloth  do not move along with the magnetic fields  that s why your fridge magnet does nt stick to your shirt or your shoes  fact 3  materials that are magnetic are affected by magnetic fields  have you ever wrapped a live wire around an iron core to create a magnet  electricity is all just moving electrons  so  when you wrap the wire around a lot of times  the electrons are moving in the same  structured way a lot of times  creating your magnetic field  the more wraps of wire  and the faster that the electrons move  the stronger of a magnetic field it creates  this wo nt happen if you wrap a wire around a pencil  the core must be magnetic  this is a property called  electromagnetecism   which is a property that all magnets exhibit  fact 4  electrons circling around a magnet create a magnetic field  do you remember that rule i mentioned before   for every action there is an opposite and equal reaction   so if electrons circling around a magnet create an electric field  you can guess what magnets circling around electrons do  you probably know that the netherregions of the earth are made up of molten iron  which is a magnet  holy crud  this molten iron is swishing and stirring in a circular motion inside the earth  wow  this creates a magnetic field around the earth  when the molten iron goes around faster  the field strengthens  and vice versa  bam  final fact  the earths magnetic field is dependent upon the movements of the molten magnets under its crust     edit   while this is all true  it s misleading  thank you random832 for bringing up magnetohydrodynamics   therefore  its safe to assume that sudden magnetic pole reversals  or geomagnetic reversals  are due to the tides of the inner  earth  we know that reversals occur on earth during periods of low magnetic intensity  beyond that  scientists are kinda stuck  geomagnetic reversal is kind of a random process  we ca nt find a pattern as to how often it occurs  and the speed at which the poles switch during a reversal is different every time  no one has any solid grasp as to when  or how long  the next geomagnetic pole reversal will be  it should also be pointed out that the sun undergoes a geomagnetic reversal every 9  12 years  and does so during times of high magnetic intensity  some theorists believe that during a sudden pole reversal  the earth s magnetic field would drop to near nothing  many harmful magnetic high  energy particles would be able to enter the atmosphere and irradiate the entire globe  solar wind would erode the surface of the planet  conversely  others theorize that the solar wind would create enough of a magnetic field around the earth to protect us from a cosmic mass extinction  however  there have been no correlations between reversals and exinctions  in 1960  a scientific survey concluded in which they recorded the magnetism of the seafloor across the atlantic ocean  they would drill out a cylinder of rock from the seafloor  a  sea core   and measure it s magnetic strength and orientation at different locations across the ocean  what they found were vertical magnetic stripes running up and down the seafloor  in 1963  a team of scietists were the first to hypothesize a sudden reversal of the earth s magnetic poles  since then  we ve found that geomagnetic reversals occur every 100000 to 1000000 years  your particular  brunhes â€“ matuyama  reversal was the latest reversal  occuring about 780000 years ago  it lasted anywhere from 1000 to 10000 years  i wish i could tell you more about the reversal  but there simply is nt that much known  go do your own internet research  just start googling  i will point out that our ancestors seemed to survive the reversal  archaelogical evidence from that time period shows that we had just discovered nuts  and simultaneously  invented the nutcracker  the giant trench in the atlantic ocean is constantly spewing new hot molten crust up from the surface  very slowly of course  but over time thousands and millions of years the magma comes up cools and hardens into new sea floor  the earth is a giant magnet  that s why compasses work and birds know where to fly for winter etc  there are bits of iron  which is magnetic  that is in the magma  it is lined up with the earths magnetic field while its hot  the little domains are pointing north and south as the magma cools to its final state  ocean floor   scientists observe the many layers of crust actually pushing europe and north america apart  they can see like a history book the different layers with different domains  each layer the domains flip consistently over a period of so many thousand years  the conclusion is the earths poles flip every so often and the magnetic poles flip  on a side note the earth is magnetic because we have a molten core of iron swirling around creating that field around our earth  which is responsible for keeping us alive actually  hope this enlightened you a little bit  i do believe it was less sudden than you might be led to believe  rapid on a geological time scale but quite long in terms of human perception of time ,0

california has a state law  proposition 65  that was passed 30 years ago or so that requires companies to warn consumers if they re selling them any product that contains certain chemicals  the intentions were good  all of these chemicals might be carcinogenic  unfortunately  99  of the time they re perfectly safe when used as intended  the problem is that the law has stiff penalties for failing to warn consumers  but there s absolutely no penalty for issuing a warning that is nt needed  so most companies add the warning to  everything  that might contain even trace amounts of any of those chemicals  just to be safe  unfortunately it just means that those warnings are useless  because it would be too costly to create a  california  only  version of the product in most cases  they make a change to make sure they can sell it in california  and just apply it to all   edited out wrongness  one of the reasons it  continues  is that suing businesses that do nt comply to the letter of the law is a great revenue source for area legal firms  you can read more  here   url0   i learned this first  hand when i used to work for a place that made nifty novelty items  some of which were made of plastic and we got targeted by one of these shake  down law firms  we got sued and had to trash an entire line of packaging across our product line because we had gotten sued for making things out of plastic and neglected to put the prop 65 warning label on the packaging and making our stuff look dangerous outside of california where people do nt know anything about this law  this is one of the dangers of the direct  democracy ballot initiative in california  casual voters have to put considerable effort in to get past the  common sense good  topline of such initiatives and learn what the more likely unintended implications are of the measure  it s one of the reasons i voted against the food labeling measure from a few years back  even though it put me on the side of evilcorps like monsanto   perfectly sensible on the surface  but the implications would have  i believe  led to another prop 65 cluster  ck ,0
so  the way that thermonuclear bombs  h  bombs  work in general is something like this  you have a typical nuclear device composed of your favorite fission bomb  uranium or plutonium   and then you ve got your fusion material  encasing the fusion material is often a uranium shell  too  to help the fusion occur  you ve probably noticed that there are lots of things in h  bombs that are nt h these things do leave fallout  an ideal hydrogen bomb has no fallout  fallout is only generated by fission reactions  however  weapons designers use a  boosted fission  device instead of a pure fusion bomb  how this works is that first  a fission reaction occurs  however  this reaction is limited by a lack of neutrons  to solve this  a fusion reaction occurs  which generates lots of surplus neutrons  this makes fission much more efficient  and has allowed us to increase bomb power beyond ww2 technology  basically  the fusion portion is a smaller  secondary reaction used to make the fission portion more powerful  yes they do  however  they create less per mtonne of explosive force than fission bombs  and the amount of fallout also depends on the method in which they are used  a fission warhead gets its explosive power from the fission of uranium or plutonium  there has been efforts to find stable isotopes of heavier elements to use in bombs  as they could theoretically be smaller  however this has nt panned out so far   thus they produce a lot of radioactive isotopes as a result of the fission  h  bombs also use a fission warhead to provide the energy required to fuse the lid that acts as the source of light atoms  this fusion gives off the majority of energy in an h  bomb  this is why h  bombs are also known as  fission  fusion  weapons this process makes less radioactive isotopes  therefore  for a given mtonnage of explosive energy  a h  bomb will release less fallout  in fact the  cleanest  weapon ever fired was tsar bomba  the largest weapon ever fired  there are some complications however  if you want to boost the power of an h  bomb even more you can make the tamper  a part of the bomb that is basically a heavy metal shell  it holds the bomb together long enough for it to work  basically   out of u238 rather than pb or w in this case the u238 will fission due to bombardment by fat neutrons released by fusion  increasing the yield of the warhead  but also increasing the fallout  in this case the h  bomb is a  fission  fusion  fission  weapon  in the original design of tsar bomba  the tamper was made out of u238  which would have given it a yield of 100mt  and released fallout equivalent to 13 of every other nuclear test combine  the ussr decided that this was unwise  and made the tamper out of lead instead  the yield was  only  50 mt and 90  of that energy came from fusion  the manner in which a weapon is used also affects the level of fallout created  if a soft target like a refinery or a city is being hit  the bomb will detonate above ground  to allow the pressure wave created to damage the greatest area possible  in this case the fallout is lower than a ground  burst  a ground  burst is when the bomb is detonated at ground level in order to damage hard targets such as missile silos  in this case  the explosion irradiates a lot of soil and shit that is also thrown into the air  leading to a high level of fallout  sucks for you if you live downwind of montana  north dakota  or wyoming  ,0
stuttering is a type of speech disorder that can cause someone to repeat or prolong certain sounds syllables or words when speaking it can also cause someone to pause or have difficulty starting a word or phrase stuttering is not a choice and it is not caused by a lack of intelligence or effortthere are several factors that can contribute to stuttering including genetics brain development and environmental factors some research suggests that stuttering may be caused by a combination of these factors for example stuttering may run in families suggesting a genetic component but it can also be influenced by a persons experiences and environmentstuttering can be a very frustrating and isolating experience but there are many ways to manage and treat it some people find that speech therapy and other forms of treatment such as learning to relax and take deep breaths while speaking can help them improve their fluency and communicate more easily if you have a stutter and would like to learn more about treatment options it is a good idea to speak with a speechlanguage pathologist or a healthcare provider,1

monte carlo sampling is a technique used in computer simulations to generate random samples from a multivariate distribution it is named after the monte carlo casino in monaco where randomness is a key feature of many games of chancennnnin monte carlo sampling random numbers are generated and used to sample values from the distribution of interest this process is repeated multiple times to generate a large number of samples which can then be used to estimate various statistical properties of the distribution such as the mean variance and distribution of the samplesnnnnmonte carlo sampling is often used in statistical modeling machine learning and other fields where the goal is to estimate some quantity based on random samples from a complex distribution it is particularly useful for modeling systems with many variables or for approximating difficult integralsnnnnone of the key advantages of monte carlo sampling is that it is easy to implement and can be used with any multivariate distribution it is also relatively fast especially when compared to more computationally intensive methods such as markov chain monte carlo mcmc however it is subject to the law of large numbers which means that the accuracy of the estimates obtained through monte carlo sampling depends on the number of samples generated as a result it is important to generate a sufficient number of samples to achieve good accuracy,1

imagebased rendering ibr is a technique in computer graphics that involves generating and rendering a scene by using images rather than geometric models and lighting calculations this technique is used to create photorealistic images or animations that are difficult or impossible to generate with traditional rendering techniquesnnnnthere are several different approaches to ibr but they all involve capturing images of a scene from different viewpoints or under different lighting conditions and using those images to synthesize a final image or animation the captured images are often called textures or environment maps and they can be used to represent the appearance of objects in the scene the lighting and shading of the scene or bothnnnnone common approach to ibr is to use a set of panoramic images also known as spherical harmonics to represent the appearance and lighting of a scene these images are captured by taking a series of photographs of the scene from a single point with each photograph covering a different direction the resulting images can then be combined to create a single highresolution panoramic image that represents the appearance of the scene from the viewpoint of the camera this image can be used to render the scene from any viewpoint within the field of view of the panoramic imagennnnanother approach to ibr is to use imagebased lighting which involves capturing the lighting of a scene using high dynamic range hdr images or light probes these images can be used to synthesize the lighting of a scene from any viewpoint allowing artists to create realistic lighting effects without having to calculate the lighting of the scene from scratchnnnnibr has many applications in film television video games and other areas where photorealistic images or animations are desired it can be used to create convincing virtual environments to generate realistic reflections and refractions and to simulate complex lighting and shading effects,1
in the united states the federal minimum wage is the lowest wage that employers are legally allowed to pay their employees however there are some exceptions to this rule one of these exceptions is for certain types of workers who receive tips as part of their job such as servers in restaurants the reasoning behind this exception is that servers in restaurants typically earn a significant portion of their income from tips rather than just their base wage because of this the government has decided to allow these workers to be paid a lower base wage as long as their tips bring their total earnings up to at least the minimum wage this means that servers in restaurants are allowed to be paid a lower wage than the minimum wage as long as they make enough in tips to bring their total earnings up to at least the minimum wage the tips that servers receive are considered to be part of their income and they are required to report them to the government and pay taxes on them just like any other income i hope this helps to explain the situation let me know if you have any more questions,1
you have a ladder  and a wall  when you put the ladder against the wall  the ladder s feet will be some distance away from the wall  and the ladder will touch the wall at some height above the ground  the ladder is easier to climb  less steep  when you pull the feet further out away from the wall   also  it s less likely to tip backwards when you climb it   so you want some way to figure out how far back you can put the feet of the ladder from the wall  but the ladder will still go to the top of the wall and allow you to climb over  an old philosopher figured out the math for how to do this  ladderlength  sqrtheightupwall2  feetdistancefromwall2  i would nt expect pre  schoolers to actually be able to do the math  just show them the formula so when they see it later  they recognize it  the pythagorean theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the square of one leg plus the square of the other leg  so  let s get some definitions in place  right triangle  a triangle with a right angle  90 degrees   just like the corner of a square  hypotenuse  the longest side of the triangle  the one opposite the right angle  leg  one of the two smaller sides of the triangle  square  a number multiplied my itself  in this case  we multiply the distance of a side of the triangle by itself  the pythagorean theorem is often shortened to a2  b2  c2 a is the length of one of the smaller sides  b is the length of the other small side  and c is the length of the longest side  the one opposite the right angle  a common example is a right triangle with side lengths of 3  4  and 5  3  2  4  2  5  2 3x3  4x4  5x5 9  16  25 the pythagorean theorem is really useful for finding the side lengths of a right triangle  if you know two sides  you can find the third  it is also the basis of more complex geometric laws  since any polygon can be divided into multiple triangles  you can find the longest side of a right triangle by taking the first short line  lets say 3 long and adding that many of them together  so you have a line made of 3 lines each three long  so it s 9 long  then you take the second short line  lets say 4  and do the same  make it 4 lines of 4  so it is 16 long  now connect the two lines together and you get a line 25 long  now to find the length of the longest side you simply need to break that line up into a number of lines that are the same length as the quantity there are of them  so for 25  the simplest you can break it down is 5 lines that are 5 long  length  quantity  so that is your length for the longest line  the hypotenuse  this is the physical representation of a2  b2  c2 ,0
sure i can explain it to you like youre five so imagine that there are lots of different companies that make phones tablets and other kinds of technology these companies all come up with new ideas and ways to make their products better they come up with these ideas by doing research and development rd sometimes they come up with ideas that are so good that they want to make sure no one else can use them without their permission so they get a special kind of permission called a patent a patent is like a special license that only the company that has it can use its like a special club that only they can be a part of if another company wants to use the idea covered by the patent they have to ask the company with the patent for permission and usually pay them some money this is called licensing sometimes companies get into fights over patents they might say that another company is using one of their ideas without permission and they want them to stop these fights are called patent wars now lets get back to google google is a very big company that makes lots of different products including phones and tablets they also do a lot of rd and come up with lots of new ideas when google buys motorola they get access to all of the patents that motorola has this means that they can use all of those ideas without having to ask for permission or pay any money it also means that they have more patents than they did before which can be helpful in the patent wars if another company is using one of googles ideas without permission google can say hey stop using our idea we have a patent for it and the other company has to listen or they might get into trouble so in short when google bought motorola they got access to a bunch of patents that they can use to protect their own ideas and make it harder for other companies to use them without permission this can be helpful in the patent wars because it gives google more power to defend their ideas and make sure that other companies respect their patents,1

the fed is trying to keep the money supply growing at a rate just slightly faster than the increase in the total production in the economy if this year we produced say 3 more goods and services than last year than they try to make the money supply grow by maybe 4 or 5 that way there should be a small rate of inflation they are trying to prevent high inflation rates on one hand or deflation on the other when the interest rate on tbills is low banks will borrow more money as the fed creates this money out of thin air when banks buy a tbill this adds money to the economy when the interest rate on tbills is high banks will borrow little or nothing as theyll be repaying older tbills this will result in less growth in the money supply or even contraction so the feds change the rate when they see that economic growth is accelerating or decelerating or that the inflation rate is getting too high or too low,0
nnews and radio networks like any other organization can have political biases for a variety of reasons one reason might be that the owner or management of the network has a particular political ideology and wants to use the network to promote that ideology another reason might be that the network hires reporters and anchors who share a particular political ideology and they report the news in a way that reflects that ideologynnit is also possible for a network to start out with the intention of being unbiased but over time certain biases may emerge due to the people who work at the network or the decisions made by the managementnnit is important to be aware of potential biases in the media and to seek out sources of information that present a variety of viewpoints on issues this can help ensure that you are getting a balanced and accurate understanding of the news,1

when you feel the wind you are actually feeling the movement of the air the wind can make you feel cold because it can blow away the layer of warm air that surrounds your body which helps to keep you warm the wind can also lower the temperature of the air that you are feeling for example if you are standing in a hot dry desert and the wind is blowing you might feel cooler because the wind is carrying away the hot air and replacing it with cooler air so even if the wind itself is not cold it can still make you feel cold by blowing away the warm air and replacing it with cooler air,1
some people snort drugs because it can give them a faster and stronger effect when you swallow a pill it has to be absorbed through your digestive system before it can enter your bloodstream and start working this can take a while especially if you have eaten recently snorting a drug allows it to be absorbed through the lining of your nose and into your bloodstream much more quickly however snorting drugs also carries some risks it can damage the inside of your nose and cause other health problems its generally safer to take medications as they are intended to be taken unless a doctor has told you otherwise,1
short answer google finances market cap calculation is nonstandard aka wrong the standard way of computing the market capitalization of a firm is to take the price of its common stock and multiply by the number of outstanding common stock shares  if you do this using the numbers from googles site you get around 134b  this can be verified by going to other sites like yahoo finance and bloomberg which have the correct market capitalization already computed the whole foods acquisition appears to be very cutanddry  investors will be compensated with 42 cash per share why are google finances numbers wrong for market cap  sometimes people will add other things to market capitalization like the value of the firms debt and other debtlike securities  my guess is that google has done something like this  whole foods has just over 3b in total liabilities which is around the size of the discrepancy you have found,0
nothing beats statistics like that found on morning star yahoo or google finance  when you are starting out there is no need to reinvent the wheel  pick a couple of mutual funds with good track records and start there   keep in mind the financial press to some degree has a vested interest in having their readership chase the next hot thing  so while sites like seeking alpha kiplingers or money do provide some good advice there is also an element that placates their advertisers   the only peertopeer lending i would consider is lending club  however you are probably better off in the long run investing in mutual funds  one way to get involved in individual stocks without getting burned is to participate in dividend reinvestment plans drips  companies that have them tend to be very well established and they are structured to discourage trading  buying is easy dividend reinvestment is easy dividend payouts are easy but starting and selling  is kind of a pain  that is a good thing,0
when you squat to lift something heavy you are using your leg muscles to do the work this can help to take some of the strain off of your back on the other hand if you bend at the waist to lift something heavy you are using your back muscles to do the work this can put a lot of strain on your spine especially if you are lifting something that is very heavy the strain on your spine can be harmful especially if you have a condition like disk degeneration squatting can be a safer way to lift heavy things because it puts less strain on your back,1
singing uses modified vowels and consonants  this will partially or even fully eliminate anyone s accent  including us americans  it just happens that many of the modifications that singing does happen to be the similar to those that define many of the american accents  so it may sound similar to an american accent  but it is not  it is a singing accent  this is an educated guess  but in vocal music singers modify vowels  basically when sung  vowels are nt pronounced exactly as they would be when spoken and are typically sung longer or shorter to suit the needs of the piece  this is done so that the words aurally blend better and the music sounds more pleasing  if you factor out the accent  based pronunciation of vowels by modifying them to fit the tone of the piece  the singer s accent in and of itself is going to be diluted  it may not make them sound more  american  outright  but it will decrease the apparent  ness of their natural accent and level the playing field in terms of pronunciation  if this violates any rules  feel free to delete this  what others have said regarding singing modifying vowels is very correct  but there are also some other things to be aware of  firstly  sometimes brits still do sound like brits when they sing  think lily allen  the arctic monkeys or the sex pistols  secondly  when a style of music becomes exported en masse from a country or accent group  it becomes stylistically appropriate to sing in something influenced by that accent  for example  when singing reggae you pretty much have to sing in a jamaican  ish kind of accent  even if you re american  or it sounds weird  same deal with hip  hop  rap where everyone sings in a  black american  accent even if they are nt black or american  although there are some other rap  hip  hop genres that are exceptions to this   also  take a look at the british anthem or australian anthem for examples of singing in british  ey or australian  ey accents ,0

when you turn the bowl or cup the cereal and marshmallows stay still because they are not attached to the bowl or cup they are free to move around on their own so they dont move when the bowl or cup moves its a little bit like if you were standing on a spinning ride at an amusement park the ride would spin around but you would stay in one place because you are not attached to the ride does that make sense,1

no  antidotes directly neutralize the poison  and do nt linger too long afterwards  vaccinations work very differently  because they involve introducing  neardead microbes into your body to train your immune system to recognize them as harmful  it would seem like it would be more productive to take very small doses of the poison to build up your immunity  i have zero medical knowledge  i did see a show where a guy hunted troublesome king cobras his whole life  from mangroves  etc   and he became deathly allergic to the antivenom  the opposite seems more likely  as the human body generally only builds up resiatances based on the  presumably non  lethal  presence of harmful materials  vaccinations work by intruducing weakened  dead  or less dangerous varriations of a germ  not by introducing the antibiotics used to fight an infection  similarly  to build up immunity to the venom or poison  you would expose yourself to a non  lethal dosage of the said venom or poison   not  the antidote  so your body builds up inherent resistance in the mechanisms on which the venom  poison operates rather than creating a dependency on the antidote  this will not necessarily work with any given venom  poison ,0
there are several potential causes for swelling and a sore on the corner of the mouth includingnnangular cheilitis this is a condition that occurs when there is inflammation at the corners of the mouth and it is often caused by a fungal or bacterial infectionnncold sores cold sores also known as fever blisters are caused by the herpes simplex virus and can occur on or around the mouthnnallergic reactions swelling and sores on the corner of the mouth may be caused by an allergic reaction to a product such as toothpaste or lip balmnnnutritional deficiencies a deficiency in certain nutrients such as iron or vitamin b2 riboflavin can lead to angular cheilitisnnits important to have a healthcare provider examine the swelling and sore to determine the cause and provide the appropriate treatment in the meantime you can try using a lip balm or cream to soothe the area and keep it moist if the swelling is severe or the sore is painful you may want to contact the healthcare provider who prescribed the penicillin for further guidance,1
when you zoom in or out on an image of a computer screen you might see weird patterns because the image is made up of tiny dots called pixels each pixel is a tiny square that is a specific color and together all of the pixels create the image you see on your screennnwhen you zoom in on an image you are making the pixels bigger so you can see each individual pixel more clearly this is why you might see weird patterns when you zoom in  because you are seeing the individual pixels that make up the image rather than the image itselfnnsimilarly when you zoom out on an image you are making the pixels smaller so the image becomes less detailed this can also cause weird patterns to appear because you are losing some of the detail in the image as the pixels become smallernni hope that helps let me know if you have any other questions,1
i think i know what you mean but for me its more a feeling of my bladder returning to normal after being stretched for a long period of time  i refer to this as a belly  button hernia  i know exactly what you mean  and i get it a handful of times a year  is this a feeling that runs between your belly button and your crotch ,0
i will add another point to chrisinedmontons answer i recognize that this is perhaps appropriate as a commentor maybe 12 of an answer but the comment formatting is inadequate for what i want to say  the magic formula that you need to understand is this  capital invested  rate of return  income per period when chrisinedmonton says that you need 300000 he is doing some basic algebra capital required  income per period  rate of return  so if youre looking at 12000 per year in passive income as a goal and you can find a safe 4 yield then what chrisinedmonton did is  12000  004  300000 you can use this to play around with different rates of return and see what investment options you can find to purchase investment categories like reits will risk your principal a little more but have some of the highest dividend yields of around 812 you would need 100000150000 at those yields  some of the safest approaches would be bonds or industrial stocks that pay dividends bonds exist around 34 and industrial dividend stocks think ge or utx or coca cola tend to pay more like 23  the key point im trying to make is that if youre looking for this type of passive income i recommend that you dont plan on the income coming from gains to the investment this was something that chrisinedmonton wasnt entirely clear about it can be complicated and expensive to whittle away at a portfolio and spend it along the way,0
death is not a fixed event that happens  something like removing a head is  right now  pretty irreversible  but so was a heart attack a couple of centuries ago  being dead is a very grey area  and sometimes you are declared dead  when in fact your body is still capable of resuming normal operations  it has not yet sustained enough damage or decay  as medical technology advances  this grey area will become larger and larger  and the philosophical questions is poses will become more relevant   legal death  is when the government officially recognizes that you are  in fact  dead  this means they ll issue a death certificate  death certificates are usually only issued when doctors make the call after attempted resuscitation  if you do nt have a dnr   or if someone finds your corpse and a positive id is made at the coroner s office  obviously you do nt come back to life in the latter situation  but in the former case  it depends on how long it takes for them to defibrillate you  shock your heart   roughly speaking  every minute they dont defibrillate you  your chances of survival go down 10    so 1 minute not defibrillated  90  chance of survival  2 minutes  80  chance  and so on   so after 9 minutes of no defibrillation  it s very unlikely for you to come back  imagine a mechanical machine  like a bunch of interconnected gears and cogs that all work together to do something  if you lock up one of the important gears  the entire thing stops working  this is pretty easy to fix  just unlock the gear and boom the machine works again  now imagine that one of the machine s functions is to maintain the existence of itself  say that some other bits wear out really easily  and the machine works to fix it  now  if you lock up one of the gears  the entire thing stops working like before  but now there is a time limit  if the machine does nt keep on going  it will not be able to fix the worn down parts  if it does not fix them  it will not be able to work right  a layman might say  the machine is broken  it ca nt repair itself  but an engineer would know that the machine can be  revived  if you just unlock the gear  if you do it in enough time  the machine will be able to fix the worn parts before they are permanently damaged  this is essentially how the body works  if your heart stops working  your cells will not get the oxygen they need to survive  that does nt mean they are dead  just that they will die if they do not get the oxygen that they need eventually  so  if we can mechanically make the heart start working again  via cpr   then the blood will start moving again  and the person will still be alive  it was a bit of a crude analogy  but i did my best ,0
the law says only the united states postal service may deliver to post office boxes  also  if the package needs to be signed for  a po box can not do this  on the other hand  it s not unusual for companies such as the ups store  fedex  kinko s  not to mention many mom n  pop stores  to offer mailboxes that do nt belong to the usps  and one can have packages  not  shipped by the usps delivered to such boxes  and during business hours  there  will  be someone there to sign for the package  maybe i m mistaken  but i always thought it was to try to avoid fraud  like  if you use a stolen credit card  it s safer to have them mail something you bought to a po box than to your home address  so by forcing a person to use a home address  it might make them think twice about using the credit card  ups will deliver to a po box  the post office signs for it  ups lists it as delivered  then you get a notification thru your po box like a yellow card  source  i have had things shipped several times this way even tho i do nt prefer this method ,0
bitmessage is a decentralized secure messaging system that allows people to send messages to each other without the need for a central server or authority it uses a peertopeer network similar to how bittorrent or bitcoin works to transmit messages between users heres how it works in a nutshell a user creates a message and selects a recipient by entering their bitmessage address the users computer encrypts the message using the recipients public key which is a long string of numbers and letters that is unique to each user this ensures that only the recipient can read the message the encrypted message is broadcast to the bitmessage network which consists of many computers called nodes that are running the bitmessage software the nodes on the network pass the message along to other nodes until it reaches the recipient the recipients computer receives the message and uses their private key which is known only to them to decrypt the message and read it bitmessage is designed to be very secure and private as it uses advanced encryption techniques to ensure that only the intended recipient can read the message it is also decentralized which means that it does not rely on any central authority or server making it resistant to censorship and tampering i hope this helps to give you a better understanding of how bitmessage works if you have any further questions please dont hesitate to ask,1
so here s why i think we get crankier when we get more tired  serotonin is a chemical in our brains that is closely tied with good moods  many antidepressants are aimed at modifying serotonin levels   but as the day goes on  we have less and less serotonin  so we get crankier and crankier  derived from  url1 url0 i really only get grumpy when people try to impede my sleep  whether that s waking me up  or doing something that delays me getting into bed  basically yes  you run out of happy juice  i m no expert in this field but basically as you get tired stress hormones begin building up in your system  get enough of these and you get side effects  irritability being one  there s a few different hormones but one of the big ones is cortisol i believe  do this regularly and you set yourself up for an increased risk of a ton of different ailments,0

black and white are not considered to be no color because they are colors just like red blue and green are colors however black and white are not considered to be colors in the same way that other colors aremost people think of colors as being the colors of the rainbow like red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet these colors are produced when light is split into its different wavelengths black and white on the other hand are not produced by splitting light into different wavelengthsblack is produced when all the colors of light are absorbed and white is produced when all the colors of light are reflected so while black and white are definitely colors they are not the same as the colors of the rainbow they are produced in a different way and have different propertiesi hope that helps to explain why black and white are sometimes thought of as no color do you have any more questions about this,1
domain theory is a branch of mathematics that studies special kinds of partially ordered sets posets commonly called domains consequently domain theory can be considered as a branch of order theory the field has major applications in computer science where it is used to specify denotational semantics especially for functional programming languages domain theory formalizes the intuitive ideas of approximation and convergence in a very general way and is closely related to topology,0

cosigning a personal loan for a friend or family member can be a risky proposition when you cosign a loan you are agreeing to be responsible for the loan if the borrower is unable to make the payments this means that if your friend or family member defaults on the loan you will be on the hook for the remaining balancethere are a few things to consider before cosigning a personal loan for someonedo you trust the borrower to make the payments on time and in full if you are not confident that the borrower will be able to make the payments it may not be a good idea to cosign the loancan you afford to make the payments if the borrower defaults if you are unable to make the payments cosigning the loan could put your own financial stability at riskwhat is the purpose of the loan if the borrower is using the loan for a risky or questionable venture it may not be worth the risk to cosignis there another way for the borrower to get the loan without a cosigner if the borrower has a good credit score and is able to qualify for a loan on their own it may not be necessary for you to cosignin general it is important to carefully consider the risks and potential consequences before cosigning a loan for someone if you do decide to cosign it is a good idea to have a conversation with the borrower about their plans for making the loan payments and to have a clear understanding of your responsibilities as a cosigner,1

sure id be happy to help you understand the difference between vulgar and classical latin vulgar latin is the everyday form of latin that was spoken by the common people in ancient rome it is called vulgar because it was the latin that was spoken by the vulgar or common people not the educated elite classical latin is the more formal literary form of latin that was used in literature poetry and other written works one way to think of the difference is to compare it to the difference between the way you might speak with your friends and the way you might speak in a formal presentation vulgar latin is like the way you speak with your friends  it is more casual and relaxed classical latin is like the way you speak in a formal presentation  it is more precise and follows strict rules i hope that helps do you have any more questions about latin,1
my smart  ass answer was going to be  from the top  pouring uphill is very difficult  this video  121 min  proves me wrong   concrete pour for dam time lapsed   url0  i pour concrete for a living  it is a major hassle  they put wooden forms around what they want cemented  when we pour the crete we make sure its thicker  add less water   pour it slower  this sucks sometimes cause if you pour it too slow it starts getting hard in the shoot of the ready mix truck  you have to find a balance really  there s usually workers there shoveling the concrete so it does nt overflow  we also pour it in sections so it makes it easier  depends on how steep the incline is  generally  they use less water in the mix so it does nt slump or flow as much  vertical walls are usually formed on both sides  and the concrete is poured into those forms and vibrated to remove any air pockets or voids  and then there is the somewhat uncommon shotcrete application  which is popular for pools  and works just like it sounds  you can see a video here   url0   url0 ,0

expense ratios are the fees that mutual funds and exchangetraded funds etfs charge to cover their operating expenses these fees are typically expressed as a percentage of the funds assets and are deducted from the funds returns high expense ratio funds are those that charge higher fees compared to other similar fundsits generally a good idea to try to minimize the expense ratios you pay on your investments as they can eat into your returns over time however its also important to consider the quality of the fund and the potential benefits it may offer in terms of performance and diversificationif a high expense ratio fund is able to deliver strong returns and meet your investment objectives it may be worth it to pay the higher fees on the other hand if a low expense ratio fund offers similar returns and meets your investment goals it may be a better choiceits always a good idea to carefully review the fees and expenses associated with any investment before making a decision its also a good idea to consider the longterm impact of these fees on your investment returns as well as your overall financial goals and risk tolerance,1
an elevated psa level can be a symptom of cancer but it is not necessarily a definitive indicator psa stands for prostatespecific antigen and it is a protein produced by cells in the prostate gland the psa test measures the level of psa in the bloodnnelevated psa levels can be caused by a variety of factors including prostate cancer an enlarged prostate also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia prostatitis inflammation of the prostate and even certain medications it is important to keep in mind that having an elevated psa level does not necessarily mean that you have cancernnit is important to undergo further testing such as a prostate biopsy to determine the cause of an elevated psa level during a prostate biopsy a small tissue sample is taken from the prostate and examined under a microscope to check for cancer cellsnnit is also important to discuss your concerns and any symptoms you may be experiencing with your healthcare provider they will be able to provide you with more information and guidance on your specific situation,1
water doesnt have a smell because its made up of just hydrogen and oxygen atoms and these atoms dont have a smell when water is mixed with other things that have a smell like salt or plants then the water can pick up the smell of those things thats why the ocean has a smell because it contains salt and other substances lakes and tap water can also pick up smells from the things that are dissolved in them or from the pipes that they travel through but pure water which doesnt have any other substances mixed in with it doesnt have a smell,1

when lumber is cut from a tree it is typically roughcut meaning it still has the bark and outer layers of the tree on it these layers are removed during the planing process which smooths out the wood and gives it a uniform thickness the planing process also removes some of the wood from the surface of the board which is why a 2x4 is not actually 2 inches by 4 inches when it is first cutafter the roughcut lumber is planed it is dried in a kiln to reduce the moisture content as the wood dries it shrinks slightly which can also cause the board to become smaller in sizeso when you see a piece of lumber labeled as a 2x4 it means that it was originally cut to be 2 inches by 4 inches but it has been planed and dried which has caused it to be slightly smaller than those dimensions,1

necklaces can get tangled in a jewelry box because they are often made of thin flexible materials that can easily twist and turn when you put a necklace in a jewelry box it might move around a little bit as you close the box or if the box is bumped this movement can cause the necklace to twist and turn and as it does it can become tangled with other necklaces or items in the box sometimes necklaces can also become tangled if they are placed in the jewelry box in a way that causes them to become twisted around each other so even though the necklaces are not moving a lot they can still become tangled because of the way that they are positioned in the box,1

i would think it could but in the inverse direction  as long as you have perfect vision  in other words  say you have 2020 vision  you put on your friend s 325 glasses  meaning they are myopic  wearing glasses with 325 brings them to zero but since you re already there  your vision will correct to 325  edit  which would give you nearsightedness    i m not an optometrist and am purely speculating but think this is how it works   according to my wife  who in order to test this very theory  put her glasses back on after putting in her contact lenses  no  not really  it will have the opposite effect  someone with 2020 vision who puts on glasses that correct for far sightedness  will experience short sightedness and vice versa  if someones eyes focus light behind the retina  the glasses will move the focal point forward  but with normal eyes those glasses will now move the focal point in front of the retina ,0
the pitcher and the catcher usually work out in advance a general strategy  so in most cases the catcher is simply  confirming  what kind of throw to expect  the pitcher will sometimes shake a signal off  which tells the catcher  no  try something else   the pitcher makes the ultimate call  but it s up to the catcher to offer suggestions   catcher   are we doing this    pitcher  shakes his head  no    catcher   how about this    pitcher   yes    now the catcher positions himself properly for the expected pitch  the catcher might also give a signal which basically says  hey  this is nt coming from me  the pitching coach is telling us to do this pitch against this batter   the catcher is  behind  the batter  so he is in the best position to do this secret signalling  if it were reversed  then the batter would know what to expect  when there are runners on base they sometimes use a more subtle signalling method  this is where that general strategy meeting that took place before the game comes in  various pitches can behave very differently and if the catcher was nt aware of which pitch was coming he would be beyond pissed  you d get more passed balls and increase the chances of someone being injured by a pitch  the signals are worked out beforehand obviously  as well as the strategy they plan to use against various batters  you will also see the catcher run out to the pitcher at times so they can discuss what is going on  both the pitcher and the catcher need to know where the ball is going  the pitcher can know what pitch to throw next but that leaves the catcher guessing what is coming next  the catcher does nt do much other than catch the ball so he is given the responsibility of calling the game  the pitcher is focused on his technique  making small adjustments to find that sweet spot for a release point for perfect control  watching runners on base and thinking about that last bad pitch he threw  hand signals can differ from team to team and even game to game but generally an index finger straight down indicates fastball straight down the middle  pointing down and left or down and right indicate an inside fastball or outside fastball  two fingers indicate curve ball and three mean change up but this all depends on the pitches that the pitcher can throw  a knuckle ball pitcher mainly throws knuckle balls so 1 is knuckle ball and 2 is fastball  when a runner gets to second base  he can see the catcher signaling the pitcher and might relay the pitch to the batter so the catcher will flash a series of signs to the pitcher  the code might be as simple as second sign so 3 fingers  1 finger  2 fingers means fastball  major league players study film of other teams all the time so the signs change all the time ,0
different parts of the body are made of different types of tissue because they have different functions bone is a hard strong tissue that helps to support the body and protect internal organs cartilage is a softer more flexible tissue that is found in areas where movement is important such as in joints for example your bones make up your skeleton which helps to keep your body upright and gives it its shape your bones also help you move by acting as levers when you lift push or pull things on the other hand your ears nose and some parts of your ribs are made of cartilage cartilage is better for these parts of the body because it is more flexible and less likely to break than bone this is important because these parts of the body need to be able to move and bend without breaking in summary different parts of the body are made of different types of tissue because they have different functions and need different properties to do their jobs properly,1
it is not uncommon for merchants to report credit card transactions to the credit card issuer as personal income this is because the credit card issuer is essentially providing a loan to the merchant when the transaction is made and the merchant is responsible for repaying that loan through a percentage of the transaction amount known as the merchant discount rateif you are concerned that your credit card transactions with square have been reported as personal income you should contact square directly to clarify the matter they should be able to provide you with more information about how your transactions are being reported and any potential implications for your personal income tax obligationsit is important to note that the reporting of credit card transactions as personal income does not necessarily mean that you are required to pay personal income tax on those transactions the tax treatment of credit card transactions depends on a variety of factors including the nature of the transactions your business structure and any relevant tax laws and regulations if you have any concerns about the tax implications of your credit card transactions you should consult a qualified tax professional for advice,1
yes  if you are prepared to own the stock and have the cash to buy it it can be a good way to generate income the downside is really no more than buying a stock and it goes down  which can happen to any investment  and you have the premium of the put just dont do it on any stock you would not buy outright to the posters who say its a bad idea i would like some more info on why they think that its not more bad idea than any investment yes it has risk but so does buying stocks in general buying dividend stocks etc and since most options expire worthless the odds are more in your favor selling puts,0
i used to wonder why the current turkish govt would see the need deny something that happened under a previous regime  but doing some more reading  fatma gocek  mostly   it seems that the whole national myth of the birth of republican turkey  more or less the country it is today  following the fall of the ottomans after ww1  is rooted in the actions of certain political leaders  many of whom it turns out were loosely or closely connected to the group which carried out the genocide  the cup   it s more complicated than that  and i think turkish politics do not help simplify the situation  but that s my general sense  so  imagine if it came out that george washington and thomas jefferson were involved in such a thing  it would be kind of a shock to our whole national history  practically  though  almost nobody is left alive from that era  and i do nt think armenia would get land or reparations as they already won their independence  and as it would be almost impossible to figure out today which additional lands they should get  at the expense of current turkish landowners  who had nothing to do with the genocide   tldr  accepting that  they  committed the genocide  the current turkish govt would have to acknowledge that many of their founding fathers may have been involved in the atrocities  a lot of the armenians killed in that genocide were primarily those living in turkey already  they were becoming politically active and wanted more rights given to them  turkey saw the opportunity in wwi to take action  ramifications  there is a mountain that used to be part of armenia which is now turkish territory  turkey in general does nt gain anything from accepting that this was a genocide  they simply call it war  with atrocities on both sides  america sees turkey as a strategic ally in the middle east  as it should  that is why you wo nt see the us accept the genocide anytime soon  but if they did  it would be to pressure turkey into doing something important for us interests  sources  i m armenian  this is what i ve picked up over the years  not restitution  turkey is currently not the beacon of cultural freedom or acceptance of difficult truths  even if they cared to admit it happened  the edrogan regime would almost certainly pull the  that was 80 years ago so we re not fiscally responsible  card  to further answer your question  there is little in the way of international redistribution of land wrongfully taken  international courts deal with the actions of individuals for the most part  it would be little more than a symbolic victory for the ethnic armenians ,0
in the case of athletes  many times they are taxed at the federal level and at the state level of  not just the state they live in but  the state in which they earned the money  let s say your a baseball player and earn 1 million dollars a year  not only do you have to pay 350 k in federal taxes but you have 81 games per season in  mostly  other states  meaning 50  of your salary is taxable in the state you live in and 50  in all the other states you played in   the tax situation can be very complicated    i m the most irresponsible person in the world  the reason i m like that is because  at 21  you all gave me  50 or  100 million  and i did nt know what to do  i m from the ghetto  i do nt know how to act  one day i m in a dope house robbing somebody  the next thing i know   you re the heavyweight champion of the world    who am i  what am i  i do nt even know who i am  i m just a dumb child  i m being abused  i m being robbed by lawyers  i think i have more money than i do  i m just a dumb pugnacious fool  i m just a fool who thinks i m someone  and you tell me i should be responsible    mike tyson  are they just not even trying to pay their taxes  well sometimes that s the case  the thing is  as others have pointed out  being rich is actually quite complicated  most rich people build up to the process  you own a local store  then you own 2 stores  then 5  then 50  then 500  or you invest in one place  then 10 then 100 or whatever  or you just own one business and that s it for your career  athletes  celebrities and lottery winners all have a problem  athletes particularly because you are at a young age with no experience with money handed a fortune  you do nt know what to do with it and you do nt even know who to ask  so you try and hire accountants and lawyers and the problem is you do nt have the skills to know the good ones from the bad  most americans ca nt do their taxes coming out of highschool for a 30k a year job  when it s 3 million earned in lots of places with all sorts of complexity you basically hire an accountant  follow their advice and hope you do nt fuck it up  assuming you know enough to even do that  wesley snipes got himself an advisor who did nt believe income tax was legal  which as you can imagine the irs does not agree with  so snipes was in a world of trouble  now in the case of athletes they are in the worst of it  because your career does nt usually gradually slide into oblivion  you make 10 million dollars one year  and 0 the next  or you get injured part way through  can not play anymore  and suddenly your lifestyle that expected making x million dollars before you retire at age 30 now has you trying to make do with 15  of x or 2  of x or whatever  and you re boned  actors can just keep working  even if you get less money you at least can make something by doing more movies and commercials and you can make bad movies or take your clothes off  do stage work etc  lottery winners and athletes though  they have no idea what to do  the guy at h  r block you pay 40 bucks to do your taxes is nt going to talk to you if you have millions in income  so you need advisors and you have very poor prospects for long term income  add to that divorces  failed business ventures  theft by crooked advisors and well  you get the idea  when you have a lot of money and you get a pet project  think 38 studios  that you hope will keep you going for years and it fails suddenly you ca nt pay your bills and part of that ends up being taxes ,0
when someone has an allergy it means that their body has an abnormal reaction to a substance that is usually harmless to most people these substances are called allergens when someone comes into contact with an allergen their immune system mistakes it for something harmful and starts to fight it off this causes a number of symptoms such as sneezing a runny nose or a rash some people are more prone to allergies than others and it is not always clear why this is the case it could be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors,1
pussy riot are a russian punk band  their music often says rude things about vladimir putin and the rest of his government  now everyone knows  sticks and stones  but vladimir got sick of the musä±c that said bad things about him so he said that they were not allowed to do that anymore  pussy riot then sang their song in the middle of a big russian church  without asking the people who owned the church first  they also said a lot of things the church did nt like in their song  which made the people that owned the church very angry  now pussy riot have been found guilty of  hooliganism  for singåÿng their song where they were not allowed to  a lot of people are mad at putin because no one ever taught him  stä±cks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me   it is about being able to say bad things about the russian government  church rather than women  i am not the best to explain this but here goes  it does nt really have to do with women s issues  it has to do with freedom in russia  russia is supposed to be a democracy but putin has been in charge since 2000  he and his government arrest and harass anyone who protests against them  pussy riot started as a band that protests against the governments crackdown on the people and their protests  they were singing at a church  or outside a church  ca nt remember  and they were arrested and charged with  hooliganism   some of there members are facing up to 3 years in jail i think  the verdict is supposed to be handed down today  i hope that helped some  the pussy riot  a russian feminist punk band  were known to be against putin  in 2012  they made a live performance  in a cathedral  praying virgin mary to make putin go away  the problem is that  a  the orthodox church is very friend with putin and did not like the performance at all b  the opposition against putin has become quite important and putin fear he might lose his power so tada  trial for  hooliganism   and a 2  year prison  read  camp  sentence  they are seen by many as political prisoners  also  a majority of russia is still christian  and many agree with the sentence     premeditated hooliganism performed by organized group of people motivated by religious hatred or hostility ,0
these processes are sort of opposites  if you think about it  curing meat is about preserving meat without cooking it  smoking meat is cooking it  albeit slowly  when you smoke meat you re basically cooking it low and slow  really low and really slow  and that process relaxes all the connective tissue and makes taste moist  despite the fact that it s really cooked to hell and back   because it s swimming in collagen  if no collagen is present  then you just get dry smoky meat  which is okay  too  curing is different  curing is basically salt and time  first  salt curing kills microbes and bacteria in your meat by removing the water in them  it also removed the water in the meat itself  making it harder and condensing the flavor  this dry meat is also less susceptible to new bacteria and microbes  because they want a moist environment  i work in a smoking factory  i m actually the smokersounds like a funny title   we put items like chicken and pork in a salt and sugar mix of water for a few days  the salt and sugar penetrate the meat through osmosis  osmosis is when high concentration substance naturally diffuses into a low concentration  basically the meat absorbs the salt internally  for bacon this takes 3 days  for chicken it is 1 day  then we smoke it  it s basically a very slow cook  bacon takes about 3 hours at 120 degrees c the wood smoke and slow cooking adds immense flavor and turns the bacon a gold color  without smoking or curing  the meat would taste raw  smoking and curing are simply ways of preserving meat and reducing bacterial growth  the curing chemicals make the meat inhospitable to bacteria  and the smoke finishes the job ,0
it depends on many factors  what age you are  in general  the younger you are the more you need  8 hours is usually a minimum for an adult  but it can also depend on how active your life is  etc  here is a tip for waking up more easily though  set two alarms  one when you have to wake up  and another that is 90 minutes before that  have a glass of water by your bed  when the first alarm goes off  wake up and drink some water  then go back to bed  because sleep happens in 90 minute cycles  you will wake up and reset that cycle  the next time you wake up  you will be approximately coming out of the cycle instead of in the middle of it  drinking the water will help prevent dehydration  which is very common when you sleep and contributes strongly to drowsiness when waking up  in addition to these  it helps to wake up at the same time every day  regardless of what time you go to bed  this regulates your internal clock and helps you wake up naturally at that time  you re not really tired  you re groggy  you re essentially in the boot  up phase â€” humans are more or less squishy computers  your body is trying to overcome inertia and get back into a world where it needs to utilize all its senses and processing power  and it s easier to just fall back asleep because living beings will instinctively gravitate toward the easier action in any given scenario  because the context and effect are both very similar when you re trying to go to sleep  it creates the illusion of being tired  that s a good question  sometimes i sleep more than 10 hours and wake up tired and dizzy  though sometimes i sleep 6 hours  wake up satisfied and have to sleep again in the afternoon ,0
when you charge a battery you re running a chemical reaction inside the battery backwards  the limit on charging is how fast that reaction can go without damaging the battery  the speed of the electric signal moving around is not what s slowing you down  batteries contain chemicals which react when you supply them with power  and then react in reverse when they are discharged  most of these chemical reactions are exothermic  they release energy when charging  recharge too fast  and it ll get very warm  since hot things expand  it ll likely break and leak battery acid  not very fun   the voltage difference determinmes how quickly the electrons move into the battery and perform the chemical reaction that allows it to act as a power source  as the battery comes closer to being fully charged  the differential decreases  slowing the process  additionally  wall and car outlets have a limited voltage for reasons both practical and conventional that limit the charging process  as has been mentioned the process is also exothermic  which can also limit charging speed  though in a home setting that s not much of an issue ,0
the adam s apple is actually the thyroid cartilage found in the throat  women have them too  in males it protrudes  and this is because their larynx  voicebox  grows larger during puberty than females   the larger voicebox accounts for the deeper voice too  this is due to the descent of the larynx during puberty in males  and most of the reason for the deepening of the voice  rather the second descent that happens in males  source  url0 excerpt from source  in adolescent males the larynx undergoes a second descent  producing the characteristic deep  male voice  this transformation also explains why men â€™s adam â€™s apples are so much more prominent than women â€™s  this change was probably sexually selected  with ancestral females preferring deeper voices   sci show explanation   url0 ,0
with regard to commodity futures a paper released in january 2010 by aulerich irwin and garcia concluded that index funds have essentially no impact on commodity futures looking at stocks a stock that gets included in a major index does increase in price it increases its turnover by 27 and increases its price by between 27 and 55 according to information cited by kula in this paper though it looks like the price increase tends to happen in the lead up to the stock being included interestingly i have read an article but cannot now locate it which states that theres a measurable albeit fairly small price bubble on stocks included in common indexes on monday mornings friday afternoons and at the start and end of the month that is the times when mutual funds are most likely to rebalance their holdings this almost certainly applies to a lesser extent to other stocks too my understanding is that the price difference was very small however generally speaking stocks which make part of wellknown indexes will tend to be in higher demand than stocks which do not it remains the case that almost all activelymanaged mutual funds are unable to consistently beat the indexes even with this taken into account,0
they either sell stuff  provide platform for others to sell stuff for commission or mostly they create advertising space and sell that  facebook have adverts on the sides which generates income  most websites use this as a form of income  other sites may sell any data they collect about you to third parties  such as insurance companies  cold call centres or anyone else like that  maybe i should create a thread elsewhere for this question  but here goes  how accurate are website value calculators  such as url0  there are others and each one has a different value so what is the best way to estimate a website s value ,0
engines are created by 3rd party companies  they are the basic part of the game that displays graphics  character interactions  and more  these engines are often used for their own games but also sold to other companies to make there games  no reason to re  invent the wheel every time  just like care engines  some are better designed  more efficient  or otherwise well coded  some are much more expensive than others and that is why efficiencies are often overlooked  a game engine is like ingredients for a dish  its like the basis of which a lot of modern games are born from since it d be too time consuming to create individual game engines for every single game  most fps games today are built from engines but what determines the end product is what the game developers make of the engine  better game engines produce more realistic physics or better experience for the player  a couple of famous ones are cryengine and unreal engine  basically every game has code that takes care of the same thing a game engine does  that is stuff like physic calculations interactions  events and how stuff is rendered  the idea of having a game engine is that you do nt have to write the code for this stuff every time from scratch  instead you write it once and say how to use it  now it can be reused by other games ,0

ionizing radiation  the dangerous kind of radiation  can damage your body s cells all the way down to the dna  which is what controls the whole cell  it s like replacing your kindergarten teacher with another 5  year old  no one would do anything they were supposed to and chaos would ensue  eventually the principal would come and get you all in trouble  maybe too complicated for a 5 year old  i will try to explain this to the next kid i see and ask if they understand  radiation can be either strong or weak  and also more or less penetrating into your body  low penetrating might be deflected by your skin  more penetrating slips past and enters into tissue  radiation sources taken into the body can more easily reach internal organs  this is not a perfect analogy  but just bear with me  think of radiation like a hurricane  your body is the land  and your cells are all the houses  if the hurricane coming over land is weak  a few windows may break in the houses  but the storm will dissipate quickly  the damage is easily repaired  and life goes on as normal almost right away  if the hurricane is very strong  or does nt dissipate quickly  as in you are exposed to radiation a long time  then the damage will be severe  there will be flooding  and the houses ca nt be immediately repaired  if a city had no power  and thousands of empty  evacuated  ruined shells of houses  you would think of it as a dead city  similar to the ravaged cells in your body  a few people may have stayed and managed to avoid damage  and go on living but without the whole city to supply them with sources of food and electricity  they will die too  strong radiation does so much damage cells ca nt fix themselves  and that tissue is dead  and ca nt regrow  imagine the damage to your body if that tissue was your stomach and digestive tract  or your liver  or heart or brain  think of cells like tiny books  the radiation then punctuates wrong words or changes the letters so the book does nt make sense anymore ,0
in probability theory and related fields a stochastic stoêšëˆkã¦stéªk or random process is a mathematical object usually defined as a family of random variables stochastic processes are widely used as mathematical models of systems and phenomena that appear to vary in a random manner examples include the growth of a bacterial population an electrical current fluctuating due to thermal noise or the movement of a gas molecule stochastic processes have applications in many disciplines such as biology chemistry ecology neuroscience physics10 image processing signal processing11 control theory12 information theory13 computer science14 cryptography15 and telecommunications16 furthermore seemingly random changes in financial markets have motivated the extensive use of stochastic processes in finance171819napplications and the study of phenomena have in turn inspired the proposal of new stochastic processes examples of such stochastic processes include the wiener process or brownian motion processa used by louis bachelier to study price changes on the paris bourse22 and the poisson process used by a k erlang to study the number of phone calls occurring in a certain period of time23 these two stochastic processes are considered the most important and central in the theory of stochastic processes24 and were discovered repeatedly and independently both before and after bachelier and erlang in different settings and countries2225nthe term random function is also used to refer to a stochastic or random process2627 because a stochastic process can also be interpreted as a random element in a function space2829 the terms stochastic process and random process are used interchangeably often with no specific mathematical space for the set that indexes the random variables2830 but often these two terms are used when the random variables are indexed by the integers or an interval of the real line30 if the random variables are indexed by the cartesian plane or some higherdimensional euclidean space then the collection of random variables is usually called a random field instead31 the values of a stochastic process are not always numbers and can be vectors or other mathematical objects29nbased on their mathematical properties stochastic processes can be grouped into various categories which include random walks32 martingales33 markov processes34 lã©vy processes35 gaussian processes36 random fields37 renewal processes and branching processes38 the study of stochastic processes uses mathematical knowledge and techniques from probability calculus linear algebra set theory and topology394041 as well as branches of mathematical analysis such as real analysis measure theory fourier analysis and functional analysis424344 the theory of stochastic processes is considered to be an important contribution to mathematics45 and it continues to be an active topic of research for both theoretical reasons and applications464748,0
undercover police operations including those where police pretend to be sex workers are not considered entrapment because they are not coercing or forcing anyone to commit a crime entrapment occurs when law enforcement officers or agents induce a person to commit a crime that they were not previously disposed to commit in other words entrapment is when the police trick or lure someone into committing a crime that they otherwise would not have committedrnrnin the case of undercover police operations the police are not trying to trick or lure anyone into committing a crime instead they are posing as potential customers or clients in order to gather evidence and build a case against individuals who are already engaged in criminal activity the individuals who choose to commit a crime in these situations are doing so of their own free will not because they have been coerced or entrapped by the policernrni hope that helps to clarify things let me know if you have any other questions,1
cancer is not contagious meaning that it cannot be spread from one person to another like an infection cancer is caused by changes mutations in the genetic material dna of cells these changes can be inherited from a parent or they can be caused by exposure to certain substances such as tobacco smoke or by certain infections ncancer begins when normal cells in the body start to grow and divide in an uncontrolled way normally the bodys cells grow and divide in a controlled way to produce new cells as they are needed but when something goes wrong with this process the cells can continue to grow and divide even when the body doesnt need them as the number of abnormal cells grows they can form a mass called a tumor nnot all tumors are cancerous benign tumors are not cancer and are usually not a threat to health they can usually be removed and do not come back malignant tumors on the other hand are cancerous and can be more serious they can invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body nso to answer your question cancer is not contagious because it is not caused by an infectious agent like a virus or bacteria that can be passed from one person to another instead it is caused by changes in the dna of a persons own cells i hope this helps,1
i think youre talking about two types of machines at least in the united states the term change  machine usually refers to a machine that accepts large denominations of currency and returns an equal amount of currency in smaller bills or coins typically these machines are used to provide coins in exchange for paper currency in which case they are also often known as bill changers exactly what bills or coins these machines return depends on the machine read the instructions on the machine to get the details theyre usually right on the machine for example my apartment building has a machine that converts small bills like ones and fives to quarters since the laundry machines only took quarters the other type of machine are coincashing machines like the coinstar machines you might see at a grocery store many banks used to have these machines as well although in my area theyre few and far between now these machines perform the opposite function of the traditional change machine and convert smaller denominations mostly coins into bill form for example if you dump all your accumulated pennies into the machine it will probably give you bills and larger coins like quarters dimes nickels in exchange after subtracting a small fee ive heard that now some of these machines may give you a gift card of some kind instead of bills although theyll still subtract a fee from your original amount usually once again just read the instructions and they should tell you when my bank had one of these machines they didnt charge a fee as long as you were a customer at the bank im sure that varies from place to place and bank to bank though wikipedias article has this to say see the article for references in some sections of the us regional banks have begun offering free coincounting services in the amount of a gift card refunds are often given in cash rather than in the form of a gift card in some cases it is not even necessary for the customer to have an account at the bank the free service is offered as a way to attract new business from individuals who are not current account holders td banks penny arcade coin counters were free and available to both customers and noncustomers in many branches but as of november 2010 the bank charges a 6 fee for noncustomers to use the machine,0
i think we need to clear somethings up about ocd  nobody s brain is just telling them to flick a light switch 13 times for no reason  ocd is an anxiety disorder  the affected person has intrusive thoughts   obsessions   for some  but not all  ritual behavior   compulsions   can relieve some of the anxiety of those thoughts  for instances  say you are afraid criminals will break into my house and murder  rape your family  images of their mangled bodies is all you can see  lock the door and keep them safe  did you lock it  lock the door  dead bodies  are you sure you locked it  blood everywhere  lock the door  did it really lock  screaming in pain  lock the door  is it really locked  make sure it s locked  death  better test that lock again  if is locks 20 times smoothly  then that is a good lock  i think the ocd brain is just bringing more  stuff  to the surface  unconscious thoughts that everyone has  someone could hurt your family very badly  rise to the conscious level and do nt go away  here is the  pathway in ocd    url0  it looks pretty complicated  but basically the front most part of your brain right above your eye decides it wants to do something  it sends a signal to another part of your brain that plans to do something  which sends a signal to do the thing  which sends a signal that makes you happy you did it  which makes you want to do it more   there is also an indirect pathway that tells you you are done doing it  in ocd  the part that tells you to keep doing it works much more than the indirect pathway that tells you to stop  in some psychiatric  and many non  psychiatric  illnesses  you can give a patient a sugar pill and they will feel better  ocd is interesting because the placebo treatment rate is 0   if you do nt give them drugs and therapy  they wo nt improve at all  abnormalities  or an imbalance in the neurotransmitter  or brain chemical  serotonin  could also be to blame  serotonin is the chemical in the brain that sends messages between brain cells and it is thought to be involved in regulating everything from anxiety  to memory  to sleep  medications known as selective serotonin re  uptake inhibitors  ssris  are often used to treat ocd  although it is not fully known why the ssri medications seem to help some people with ocd  brain imaging studies have been used to show the differences between the brains of people with ocd and those without ocd  but the scientific community is split over whether what researchers have found is a cause for  or a result of  having the disorder ,0
a huge portion of what we think of as taste is actually the smell of food  when you â€™re sick  a lot of times your nose gets really congested and your sense of smell is severely diminished  leading to changes in the taste of food taste bad  or taste bland  the bland is the mucous blocking your olfactory sensors  i have totally anosmia  meaning i have zero sense of smell  people will ask me what it s like to taste  i was born this way  so i usually go  imagine what food tastes like when you re sick  but for your entire life  as for taste bad  the immune system creates proteins  tnf  to fight infections which tastes bitter  or rather makes the bitter in food stand out  when your body is sick it needs to conserve energy to fight and disgust food uses energy  one the reasons you get tired after a big meal  chicken noodles soup is easy to eat when you â€™re sick because it is warm  which is quicker to digest than colder foods  and is a liquid which is something your body desperately needs when it â€™s fighting  tea usually sounds good to some people when they â€™re sick for this same reason ,0
i heard once that investigating ones own excrement is ingrained into us to spot check for problems  whether this makes us more receptive to our own smells or not i have no idea  but that may have something to so with it  probably a remnant of ancient territorial instinct  many animals mark their territory with their scent through shit and other excrements  though  i could be wrong  so i d wait for someone who knows more about the subject  i kind of like the smell of my farts  but definitely not of my shit  but my shit does nt usually smell very bad  for whatever reason ,0
good question the traditional way of writing the roman numeral for 4 is actually iv with the letters i and v representing the numbers 1 and 5 respectively the roman numeral for 5 is v and the roman numeral for 1 is i when you want to write the number 4 using roman numerals you put the letter i in front of the letter v to represent the number 4 this is because the romans used a system called subtractive notation which means that they would use one symbol to represent a certain number and then use a different symbol to represent a smaller number that they wanted to subtract from the larger number in this case the roman numeral iv represents the number 4 because it stands for the number 5 minus the number 1rnrnhowever on some watches and clocks the roman numeral for 4 is written as iiii instead of iv this is simply a design choice and it has no special meaning some people believe that using iiii instead of iv makes the watch or clock face look more balanced and symmetrical but this is just a matter of personal preference,1
ridge regression is a method of estimating the coefficients of multipleregression models in scenarios where the independent variables are highly correlated it has been used in many fields including econometrics chemistry and engineering also known as tikhonov regularization named for andrey tikhonov it is a method of regularization of illposed problemsa it is particularly useful to mitigate the problem of multicollinearity in linear regression which commonly occurs in models with large numbers of parameters in general the method provides improved efficiency in parameter estimation problems in exchange for a tolerable amount of bias see biasâ€“variance tradeoffnthe theory was first introduced by hoerl and kennard in 1970 in their technometrics papers â€œridge regressions biased estimation of nonorthogonal problemsâ€ and â€œridge regressions applications in nonorthogonal problemsâ€ this was the result of ten years of research into the field of ridge analysisnridge regression was developed as a possible solution to the imprecision of least square estimators when linear regression models have some multicollinear highly correlated independent variablesâ€”by creating a ridge regression estimator rr this provides a more precise ridge parameters estimate as its variance and mean square estimator are often smaller than the least square estimators previously derived,0
salt helps melt ice because it lowers the freezing point of water when you add salt to ice the salt dissolves in the film of liquid water that is always present on the surface of the ice forming a brine solution that is colder than the ice itself this brine solution has a lower freezing point than pure water so it can cause the ice to melt even if the temperature is below the normal freezing point of waternnso when you sprinkle salt on an icy surface the salt dissolves in the thin film of water on the surface of the ice forming a brine solution this brine solution has a lower freezing point than the ice so it causes the ice to melt the salt also works to break down the bonds between the ice crystals making it easier for the ice to melt as the ice melts the water from the melted ice mixes with the salt water diluting the salt concentration and raising the freezing point of the mixture eventually the salt water will reach a point where it is no longer able to lower the freezing point of the water and the melting process will stopnnin summary salt helps melt ice because it lowers the freezing point of water causing the ice to melt the salt also works to break down the bonds between the ice crystals making it easier for the ice to melt,1
when you say  deaf   do you mean  total lack of hearing   if so  then they do nt hear anything when they think  because  hearing  is something that they ca nt even fully conceptualize  however  most of our thoughts are nt in language in the first place  for instance  if you re driving home and realize that you need to stop by the store to buy more milk  the first thing in your brain is nt a fully formed phrase of   i need to buy milk   it s likely going to be something like a mental image of you pouring the last of the milk on your cereal that morning  and a kind of  oh yeah  realization  none of that is in words  and stuff like that makes up the majority of your thoughts  for structured  conversational thought  where you use an internal dialog  a congenitally deaf person would think in either written words  or sign language  this is a pretty commonly asked question   here   url0  is a response from somebody who was born deaf  if they were born complete deaf  they do nt hear anything  not even in their minds  they quite literally think in sign language  you are used to a mental voice because that is what you are familiar with  but the brain can think in many different ways and language takes many different forms  that is sound is a conception for you  the deaf use the conception of shapes ,0
most races are run counterclockwise because it is more natural for people to run or move in that direction if you stand with your arms stretched out to your sides the left arm is usually weaker than the right arm this is because most people are righthanded and use their right arm more often than their left arm so the right arm is stronger in a race if everyone is running in the same direction the person on the inside of the curve will have to run a shorter distance than the person on the outside of the curve if the race were run clockwise the person on the inside of the curve would have to use their weaker left arm to navigate the curve while the person on the outside of the curve would have to use their stronger right arm this would give the person on the inside of the curve an unfair advantage therefore it is more fair to run the race in the opposite direction so that everyone has to use their weaker arm to navigate the curve this is why most races are run counterclockwise,1

drinking salty ocean water can actually make you more dehydrated because the high salt content of the water can cause your body to lose more water when you drink water that has a high salt concentration your body tries to get rid of the excess salt by producing more urine this causes you to lose more water which can lead to dehydration in addition the salt in ocean water can also cause other problems the salt can irritate the lining of your digestive system and cause nausea vomiting and diarrhea which can also lead to dehydration its important to remember that the ocean is not a safe source of drinking water if you are stuck on a boat in the middle of the ocean and dont have access to fresh water its important to find other ways to stay hydrated such as by collecting and purifying rainwater or using a desalination device to turn seawater into drinking water,1
sure avocados and bananas both produce a gas called ethylene as they ripen ethylene is a hormone that helps fruits and vegetables ripen when avocados and bananas are stored together the ethylene gas that the bananas produce can speed up the ripening process of the avocados this is why people often store avocados with bananas to help them ripen faster does that make sense,1
top stories get viewed by more people and therefore allows the ads posted to be seen by more people  it s all about the ad revenue for fb  especially on the mobile platform  the answer to every question about facebook is   how can we monetize this   i run a page for a website that has 12 million facebook fans  i post several status updates and photos a day  and i am lucky if the reach for any of them breaks past 10000  less than 1  of the people who have liked the page  and specifically asked to be show content from it on their news feeds  see any individual story  that s what we get for not pouring money into promoted posts  remember  kids  if something is free  you are the product being sold  my theory  if you have 200 or so friends and you look at most recent posts on your wall  typically you would just read down the page until the last post you remember reading from the last time you logged in to facebook and then you would quit facebook  if you login a few times a day  it might only be 5 or 10 posts you would see as new  have a quick look at and then logout  but facebook want you to spend longer scanning your wall so they can insert more sponsored posts in there  therefore they order by top stories or most recently commented on so you might see the same story again and again and you have to scroll down quite a way to figure out if you have all the newish stuff  this keeps you on the page longer  makes you see more ads  sponsored posts and makes them more money  just a theory  ,0
so essentially the swiss national bank  snbdecided to remove a currency cap which was set in place in 2011 to fight against the strong increasing value of the currency against the euro  back then it almost hit a point of parity  close to even value for currency  and the swiss export industries  mainly tourism  were greatly suffering  now the cap which was set at 120 to the euro has been removed and the currency appreciated to it s natural value which as of right now is exactly in parity to the euro  the situation is crazy  the currency appreciated by a ridiculous amount in almost 15 minutes  the snb did this in order to fight the quantitative easing the european central bank is going to be implementing soon to help the struggling euro zone nations such as italy  portugal  ireland  spain  greece which all combined have a many trillions in state debt and are all fighting huge levels of unemployment  so to sum up the currency cap was removed  the currency sky rocketed to it s natural value and the swiss export industries are suffering greatly  source  my roommate who is a very active forex trader hope i did nt fuck up as i m on mobile while of course it s more complicated than this  essentially  the swiss economy has been doing a lot better than the eurozone economy  which meant the swiss franc was rising relative to the euro over time  this is bad  in some ways  for switzerland because it means eurozone nations must pay more to import swiss products  swiss companies want a  weaker  franc  so the rest of europe will buy their products from them rather than someplace cheaper  so  the swiss national bank decided to enforce an artificial cap on the exchange rate at 12 francs per euro  with this cap in place  12 to 1 was the lowest it could get  but it could always go higher  thus  traders and investors bet on the euro to rise against the franc  feeling safe due to the cap  in addition  since currency usually only moves a  in the short term  investors can borrow a lot more money to trade  however  the swiss national bank abruptly removed that cap  which caused the franc to immediately rise 30  and since the change was so rapid  most could not sell their investments fast enough  now those who borrowed money are in a lot of debt or insolvent  which included the largest foreign  exchange broker in the us and asia  fxcm  inc both the swiss decoupling and the us stock decline are likely a response to the upcoming ecb qe  which is probably going to be of a truly massive scale  my best guess is draghi let the swiss and a few favored private banks  like draghi s bffs at goldman  know that not only was qe coming  but that it will be larger than expected  the snb was forced to surrender the peg  as holding it would have exposed the balance sheet to insolvency  they also had to do it secretly and suddenly  since any announcement of a future plan to abandon a peg exposes a central bank to massive losses   the kicker is the snb may still try to knock down the franc by buying non  euro currencies  primarily the usd   it will also likely try to reduce its accumulated stock of toxic euros by selling at strategic times  which will encourage macro funds to bet against the euro  if i were gambling  i d predict usdeur parity sometime in early 2016  since yellen has thus far seemed disinclined to keep doing big qe  which has likely created massive us asset bubbles  ,0

try to remember what you were doing 3 hours ago  it takes a little thought  now imagine if you had no context clues as to what you did before or after that  you can learn to remember your dreams if you make a conscious effort to do so as soon as you wake up  writing down what you remember can help  also  you can train yourself to have  lucid dreams   url0   the interesting and tricky thing about dreams  though  is that they can combine very real emotions on your part with images built from bits and pieces of your day so that  for example  you can spend your entire dream with someone who you  know  is your best friend or spouse or child or whatever  and yet you ve never really met them  it can be confusing when you wake up because you re left with the vague visual image of a stranger and yet a strong emotional connection to them  if you try to write down your dreams  focus on the plot and the emotions you felt  the characters in them are just archetypes to you  and  bonus freebie  ever heard about freud and dream interpretation  well  his theories are bunk  because he assumed that there was a common dream symbolism that was the same for everyone  eg  trains  death   wrong  the symbols in your dreams are unique to you  and you re the only one who can interpret them based on your feelings  emotions  experiences  etc  for example  when i was younger  i used to frequently dream that i was in chicago  a city that i only ever visited once  briefly  when i was about thirteen  to me  dream chicago probably represented resentment that my parents did nt find it interesting to explore the place while we were passing through  to someone born and raised in chicago  it would obviously mean something quite different  as it would also have a very different meaning to someone who  say  had never been there but had watched lots of 1930s gangster movies set there  and so on  dreams are basically your brain doing housekeeping while you re not consciously using that organ  learning to remember them  interpret them as they have meaning to you  and to participate in them actively is a very useful and interesting skill to cultivate  your mind is used to remembering important things  dreams are not very important and you rarely use those memories for anything in your daily life  the same way people often forget about things that are routine  for example  your drive to work  because they ve learned that these are not useful memories  if you want to work on remembering your dreams  you can create a dream journal  either on paper or on your computer  and sit down to write about your dreams every morning  just the act of creating a journal  even if it s empty  and taking time to remember and write down your dreams every morning will help  by doing this  you are telling yourself that you need those memories for something  i used to forget my dreams all the time  then i started a dream journal and now i remember an average of about one dream a night ,0

excellent question  im not aware of one i was going to say go visit some personal finance blogs but then i remembered that i write on one and that i often get a commission if i talk about online accounts so unless something is really bad im not going to post on it because i want to make money not chase it away this isnt to say that im biased by commissions but among a bunch of online banks paying pretty much the same crappy interest rate and giving pretty much the same often not crappy service im going to give air time to the ones that pay the best commissions  that and some of the affiliate programs would kick me out if i trashed them on my blog this also would taint any site blog or not that does not explicitly say that they do not have affiliate relationships with the banks they review i suppose if you read enough blogs you can figure out the bad ones by their absence but that takes a lot of time  seems like youd do all right by doing a bank name sucks google search to dig up the dirt that or call up  email  post on their forum any questions you have about their services before sending them your money  if theyre up front theyll answer you,0
there are a few of things that make chernobyl still far more radioactive than hiroshima and nagasaki  first  the bombs actually did nt use very much radioactive material  all things considered  a nuclear reactor consumes much greater quantities of fuel than does a bomb  since the bomb is made to go boom and then be done with while the reactor needs a long  energetic  sustained reaction  second  the fissile material in the atomic bombs was vaporized  i do nt mean that it disappeared  completely  but i mean was turned into plasma in the explosion  this pushed it much higher in the atmosphere and spread out the material over a huge distance  without large concentrations  what little radioactive decay takes place over time  remember that u235 and p239 have fairly long half lives and do nt release a ton of highly energetic particles when they do decay  quickly became nominal compared to the standard background radiation  third  very little of the fuel actually turned into the more dangerous radioactive intermediates  the percentages of the fuel actually consumed in those bombs is minute  more modern nuclear weaponry may leave longer lasting radiation  so that s what happened in the bomb areas  big releases of radiation at the time of explosion  but not much retained in the soil and region afterwards  in chernobyl  on the other hand  large quantities of highly radioactive material were released into the atmosphere because of the heat from the fire generated  this includes radioactive steams  heavy water   irradiated metals  intermediates  large quantities of spent and active fuels  the works  these were concentrated on the town  and were nt largely consumed in a big nuclear boom  most of those materials do nt actually go boom either  as a result of the varying half lives and the extremely large quantities of material in the area  it s still very radioactive  especially near the core which got a logarithmically greater dose than the surrounding areas  firstly  one was a bomb  and the other was a powerplant  with the hiroshima bomb  the nuclear reaction was a high yield  but quick acting nuclear explosion  since the chernobyl was a power plant  it was designed for longer lasting  but small yielding  nuclear reactions  even after the incident  the nuclear core kept going and going  expelling more and more radiation  it is like a bomb that has been exploding for years rather than for a second  chernobyl is nt really uninhabitable  iirc the other 3 reactors at the power plant stayed operational until 2002  people went to work shortly after the meltdown and have not died nor developed cancer outside the normal population  the town of pripyat which was built for the powerplant  is currently inhabited by ukrainians that moved back shortly after the disaster  and they are doing fine  the radiation levels have dropped of so much that you get more radiation eating a banana or flying on a commercial plain than you do living in pripyat  this is a very good question  and people more knowledgeable than i will fully answer it for you  it just  kind of  grinds my gears that people  not necessarily you  think that more than 100k people died at chernobyl and that its some giant green glowing crater  check out the documentary pandora s promise  a great film from former anti  nuclear activists who have now fully changed their minds due to thorough science  the majority of the nuclear energy scare was due to most people associating it with bombs  and  still currently active  propoganda and lobbying from the fossil fuel industry ,0
4th generation jeweler  gia certified  and former sales manager for  one of the world s largest diamond manufacturers   url1  here   diamond cutting wiki   url0  diamonds are cut in several different ways  most of them are cut using the traditional method of using steel saws impregnated with diamond dust to cut along the natural cleavage planes in the diamond to shape and facet it  lasers are a new technology developed in israel within the last 20 years  it is more expensive than traditional cutting methods  and is not cost  effective to do it for all diamonds  diamonds are cut with one thing in mind  maximize weight retention  not all diamonds are cut the same shape  this usually depends on the shape of the rough  uncut raw diamond  and the type and location of inclusions  80  of all diamonds are cut into round brilliants  and the cut is assigned a grade if the stone gets sent to a laboratory  by chipping at weak spots  imagine you find a toy car that has been dipped in plaster or concrete  the toy is bigger  but is nt as pretty or work as well  so  you want to get rid of the concrete  with a saw you risk cutting up the car  wrecking the tires  or ruining the paint  but the concrete has cracks in it  and if you hit them just right with a chisel the concrete pops off  so you have to be very careful and slow  and pick the right weak spots  otherwise you could hurt the car  if you do it right  you have the toy and it is worth much more than when it was covered in concrete  the only thing string enough to cut diamond is diamond  so when someone wanted to cut a diamond they will either have to use a tool made of diamond  which i have never seen before  or put some diamond powder tiny crystals on a regular tool ,0
marijuana is still illegal at the federal level in the united states despite the fact that many states have legalized it for medical or recreational purposes in order for marijuana to be federally legalized it would require a change in the law nthe process for changing a federal law in the united states involves several steps first a bill a proposed law must be introduced in congress this bill must then be debated and voted on by members of the house of representatives and the senate if the bill passes in both chambers it goes to the president to be signed into law nthere are several ways that a bill can become a law but this is the most common process it can be a long and difficult process and it requires the support of a majority of lawmakers and the president nso in order for marijuana to be federally legalized a bill would need to be introduced in congress debated and voted on and then signed into law by the president this would require a lot of support from lawmakers and the general public as well as some negotiations and compromise,1
well it actually kind of has  just not in the way people expected  the problem is the kind of solar you are thinking about  the green square panels  they are really  really expensive  and not terribly efficient  those systems can take 10  20 years to generate enough electricity to pay for themselves  second problem is they do nt scale well  each individual cell generates its own power  that power than needs to be run down a wire and combined with all of the power generated by each other cell  and this infrastructure to move the power and take the individual small amounts of power and convert them into high voltage ac current to be put into the grid is expensive  we live in a profit driven world and photo voltaic cells just do nt make sense at an industrial scale  however that is not to say the solar has not made major improvements  it has  and even though you do nt see it every day it is nearly ubiquitous at this point  its just not fancy looking green photo  voltaic cells that have  it is concentrated solar powercsp  systems that have  these systems use mirrors and lenses to magnify the intensity of the sun onto a relatively small point  this small point contains a system that turns heat into steam and turns a steam turbine to create electricity  they are much cheaper at scale because the mirrors and mounting brackets for them do not require the level of manufacture that photo  voltaic does  if solar is ever to take hold at the kind of level required to become the major source of power for the world it is going to be csp systems that do it  and not photo  voltaic  csp systems are the only solar solution that can compete with fossil fuels on a price per kwh basis  it was calculated that the entire world power consumption could be met by covering 1  of the world s desert climate with csp  it is also expected that within the next 10 years csp should be more cost efficient than fossil fuel  it has made massive improvements  it s gone from something that could only power calculators  very low power application  or nasa spacecraft  high power and expensive  to something that anyone can stick on their roof  there s been a steady improvement in panel efficiency  in the past decade   url1   price has been  falling steadily   url0  at the same time  and as a result  the installed capacity of solar tripled from 2010  2012  so why is nt it ubiquitous  several reasons  first  the advances have all been incremental  so there have nt been huge leaps  just a slow  steady improvement that s harder to notice  second  it s starting from almost nothing installed  so tripling the number from almost nothing  to slightly more than almost nothing still leaves you with little installed capacity  and most installations are done on a site by site basis of panels on the roof of a building  it produces little dribbles of energy here and there  which does nt quickly add up to massive percentages of power used  in short  it just takes time for these kinds of things to spread  why do you think it should  we are limited  like every aspect of science is  it s not like scientist will think  oh  i need new solar panels  and there pops up new solar panel  some technologies needs years  or even decades of slow and tedious research  and we did major breaktroughs in last 20 years and price went down pretty substantialy ,0
options trading on canadian stocks is available for a limited number of companies because options markets are typically established and maintained by exchanges and exchanges will only list options on a security if there is sufficient demand for it this means that in order for options on a particular canadian companys stock to be traded there needs to be a sufficient level of interest among market participants in buying and selling options contracts on that securitythere are a number of factors that can influence the level of demand for options on a particular security one of the most important is the underlying securitys liquidity or the ease with which it can be bought and sold in the market securities with high liquidity such as those of large wellestablished companies with a lot of trading activity are more likely to have options markets than those with lower liquidity additionally the volatility of the underlying security can also be a factor as options traders often prefer to trade options on securities that exhibit a high degree of price movementits also worth noting that options markets are not available for every security on every exchange in canada options trading is primarily conducted on the montreal exchange mx which is a subsidiary of the tmx group the mx lists options on a limited number of securities and the specific securities that are eligible for options trading can vary over time based on a variety of factors including market demand and regulatory requirements,1
when you buy a gift card  you are giving the company an interest free loan  that in itself is good enough for them  ever had a gift card expire  free money for the store  gift cards expire  get lost  have money left on them  are exclusive to that store  brand  website  these all lead to high profit margins on them  gift cards do have costs associated with using them though  most places get charged some kind of fee for every time they are swiped for a transaction  so if people actually used 100  of the money on them they would nt be worth it  this is more relevant for smaller businesses though ,0
cats purr when theyre happy but they also purr when theyre anxious scared or in pain scientists arent exactly sure why cats purr but they think it might be a way for cats to communicate with their human caregivers or to soothe themselves when theyre feeling stressed purring is made possible by the movement of a small bone in a cats voice box called the laryngeal muscle which vibrates when the cat exhales this vibration causes the cats vocal cords to produce the sound we hear as purring as for whether lions purr its not clear lions are not domesticated like cats so they dont have the same close relationships with humans lions are also much larger and more powerful animals so its not safe to try to pet or stroke a lion its possible that lions might make similar sounds when theyre feeling content or relaxed but we dont have enough information to say for sure,1
i like your question because it is one of those things that  for all practical purposes  is a simple answer  but it is a simple answer due to a lot of complicated parts  first off  when it comes to trying to understand ownership of  intellectual property   property that you ca nt physically touch   it is important to approach it layer  by  layer  here  for example  we are talking about a  song   for example  a song can be   the potential of a recorded song  lyrics you ve written down  a music composition you re developing  etc    a recorded song that you can listen to  share  etc  to help make this all clear  let s break it down into different scenarios    scenario  1   so let s say that i am a songwriter  i have written a song that involves me singing while playing my acoustic guitar  i own the lyrics to my song under copyright and i also own the  composition  of me playing music accompanying those lyrics  this does nt mean someone else ca nt coincidentally come up with the same exact song on their own and own their version  it just means that no one is allowed to straight up steal my lyrics and composition from me    scenario  2   same as scenario 1  except now i want to record my song  i decide to use my iphone to record myself playing the song  i now own that recording of the song in addition to the components of the song  lyrics  guitar playing     scenario  3   same as scenario 1  except now i want to record my song   professionally    it takes effort and skill to properly record music  so i call my friend bob who has a recording studio in his house  and i go over there and have him record me playing  bob is a friend  so he sends me an mp3 of the recording after we are done  but who owns what  i own the components of the song  but bob owns that specific recording of me playing  this means that if i were to try to sell that mp3  bob would have a right to step in and stop me  it would be arguable that bob gave me a   license   to use that mp3 in certain personal ways  to play for friends  to upload it on my facebook  etc    but just because bob recorded  me  playing  my  song does not mean i own  his  recording  after all  the recording is a product of his efforts  on his machinery  this is why concerts often do not allow fans to record the show and include specific legal small print on the tickets themselves  or when you buy the tickets   because when you record their show  you own that recording of the music  so if you were to share that recording  it would nt be infringement  however  they will come after you under the guise of  you agreed not to record  and you did  so you broke our agreement     sidenote   think of copyright as a sticky blob that comes into existence the moment someone  creates  something through their own efforts  once it happens  un  sticking it from a person is complicated  the only way to defeat this is to make sure you have contracts in place that intercept the copyright from sticking  for example  if you pay me to make you a logo or code a website for you  i own the copyright on your logo or on the code of your website  paying me just gives you a license to use it  like in scenario  3 above   the only way for you to legally own a copyright for something i create is to have a contract before hand that says i am creating a  work for hire   which means the copyright wo nt stick to me and  instead  sticks to you    scenario  4   like scenario 3  i want to record my music professionally but ca nt do it myself  it used to cost upwards of  250000 to launch an album  this includes all the costs from start to a finished  plastic  wrapped  designed album   in steps a  recording label   a record label is just like an investor  most people do nt have the money to successfully launch their album  moreover  there are so many artists out there  it is hard for any one artist to get attention  record labels are businesses that try to make a commodity out of music  they spot trends or potential  start up  artists  approach them  and say   hey  we will cover all of the costs of producing your music in exchange for x ownership of the final product  the album    so i work with the record label and the employees of the record label  all of whom have employment contracts that make their efforts  work for hire  for the record label  to produce an album  who owns what  i still own the components of my music  because i created it before signing onto the record label  without any contracts  the producers and audio engineers would each own a piece of the final recording  but like we already talked about  those things are pre  empted by contracts  so the end  ownership of the recording of my song is held by the record label  this means that if for some reason i decide i want to release my music for free  for example  i would be violating the record label s copyright to release the recording they own  that means i would need to re  record my song with a different studio  under a different contract that makes  the studio s efforts  a  work for hire   which gives me an exclusive copyright over the finished work    scenario  5   expanding on scenario 4  let s say that i am such a big artist that the label is basically paying me a salary  they offer me  2 million per year to be  contracted  as an artist under their label  while under contract  i write a new song that is the biggest hit in the history of music  who owns what  as long as the label did their homework when they wrote the contract  and you can be sure that they did   it will include language that makes me  basically  an employee of the label  which means even though i wrote the song  the label paid me to write it via the salary  this means that i own nothing  not the lyrics  not the composition  not the final product    tldr   who owns what depends on the business deals going on behind the scenes  absent any special circumstances  whoever  touched it last  generally owns the final product  but not necessarily all the components that went into the product  but those special circumstances almost certainly exist  especially in this day and age  source  i m a third  year law student with about 10  years experience in intellectual property  such as copyrights  and 4 years of experience in the music industry  the songwriter owns the composition  so  let s take the song  always on my mind   it was written by johnny christopher  mark james and wayne carson  they own the song  but that song has been recorded by dozens of performers  so  brenda lee  andor her label  owns the version that she recorded  ditto for elvis  and willie nelson  and the pet shop boys  none of that dilutes the rights of the songwriters  they get a cut anytime any cover version is sold  in theory  someone writes a song and copyrights it  then  they could own it for some time and be the only people allowed to play it and profit from it  marketing and publishing a song is expensive  thought  prohibitively so  so most artists sell their copyright to some company who specializes in buying and monetizing copyrighted songs  because they are the ones who add value  they call the shots and typically pay very poorly to the artist  with some notable exceptions like madonna and the beatles  what they ve done is find a way to turn art into a product and  after it leaves the hands of the original artist  it is seen as  property  and treated exactly the same way  it can be sold many times over  it can be exploited by the people who bought it  it can be shelved so it wo nt compete with some other product  the short answer to your question is  in almost all cases  the song is owned by whoever paid for it ,0
there could be a few reasons why some novice shooters lean back before pulling the trigger one reason could be that they are nervous or anxious about shooting the gun and are trying to brace themselves for the recoil of the gun leaning back can also be a natural instinct when someone is feeling uncertain or uncertain about what they are doing another reason could be that the shooter is not properly aligned with the gun and is trying to compensate by leaning backnnit is generally more natural to lean into the shot as this helps the shooter maintain good balance and control of the gun to explain this to a child you could say that leaning into the shot is like leaning into a punch in a boxing match when you lean into a punch you are able to stay on your feet and maintain your balance the same is true when shooting a gun by leaning into the shot you can stay steady and in control of the gun which will help you aim more accurately and shoot more confidently,1
first you have to understand the numbers you are dealing with  the  1 gig sec  statistic is not a referring to gigabytes  it is referring to gigabits  1 gbit  1000 mbit  125 megabytes  so at peak  google fiber advertizes 125 mb  s for both upload and download  that is peak  it will probably not provide that  it is a theoretical max   also  content providers will likely not be able to provide data that fast  for example  just because you have google fiber  does not mean you will be able to download a game on steam at 125 mb  s next  modern hard drives are typically connected in one of two ways  sata ii or sata iii  sata ii has a theoretical max transfer speed of 24 gbit  s or 300 mb  s which is more than double the theoretical max of google fiber  sata iii is 48 gbit  s or 600 mb  s  almost 5 times the theoretical max of google fiber  on to disk drives  depending on manufacturer of the hdd  the average read  write speed could be upwards of 120 mb  s which is still at the top end of google fibers theoretical max  if you are using an ssd  the write speed is typically above 200 mb  s with high end drives reaching 500 mb  s ram should not be an issue  tldr  the theoretical maximum transfer rate of all components in your computer is greater than google fiber  actually  google fiber is nt sending as much information as you think  data connections are measured in  bits  per second  memory on things like your hard drive are measured in  bytes   which are 8  bits   that means you would need 8 seconds of 1 gigabit  per second connection to download one gigabyte  of information  roughly   most sata iii hard drives are capable of handling up to 6 gigabits  per second  so they re still more than capable of handling those speeds   surely the disk ca nt record data at 1 gig sec right  that s 125 megabytes per second  not really that fast  traditional platter hard drives  ya  they re only about 70 mb  good ones can be up around 100  your gpu can push 150  300 gigabytes  yes  bytes  per second  your dvi cable  for a regular single link can handle 4 gigabits per second  a solid state drive can run in the 500  600 megabyte per second range  so 4 or 5x faster than google fibre  so  theoretically if you re trying to write directly to disk and you re using a regular old 7200 rpm platter drive  ya  google fibre just barely saturates it  but most computers you talk to ram first  which is easily a couple of hundred x faster than google fibre   do nt get me wrong  google fibre is fast  and traditional platter drives are slow  even though the interfaces they use can support much higher speeds you only get those out of ssds   but there s a lot of stuff inside your computer running way way way way way way faster than google fibre ,0

time is a concept that we use to measure the duration of events and the intervals between them it is not an illusion in the sense that it does not exist but rather it is a human invention that helps us understand and organize the world around usnnthink of time like a ruler just like a ruler is a tool that we use to measure the length of an object time is a tool that we use to measure the duration of events just like a ruler does not have any inherent properties of its own time does not exist independently of the events and processes that happen in the worldnnso when people say that time is an illusion they are usually trying to point out that our perception of time is subjective and that it is not an objective reality in the same way that physical objects are for example time might seem to pass more quickly when we are having fun or more slowly when we are bored or in pain this is because our perception of time is influenced by our experiences and our state of mindnndoes that make sense let me know if you have any other questions,1
life insurance is an important consideration for anyone regardless of their age or income level however the type of life insurance that is appropriate for a person who is over the age of 60 and has dependents will depend on their specific circumstances and financial goalssome factors to consider when deciding on life insurance for someone in this situation includefinancial dependents do you have financial dependents such as a spouse or children who rely on your income to pay for their expenses if so you may want to consider a life insurance policy that will provide financial support to your dependents in the event of your deathoutstanding debts and financial obligations do you have any outstanding debts or financial obligations such as a mortgage or loans that your dependents may be responsible for paying if you were to pass away if so you may want to consider a life insurance policy that will provide financial support to your dependents to help them pay off these debtsretirement savings do you have enough savings to support your dependents after you retire if not you may want to consider a life insurance policy that will provide financial support to your dependents after you retirehealth your age and health will be important factors in determining the cost and availability of life insurance if you are in good health you may be able to get a more affordable policythere are several types of life insurance to consider including term life insurance whole life insurance and universal life insurance each type has its own pros and cons so its important to research and compare options to find the one that best fits your needs and budget its also a good idea to speak with a financial advisor or insurance professional to get personalized advice and recommendations,1
i actually just did that with my chase freedom card they rotate categories every 3 months and from apriljune it was 5 back at grocery stores  so i bought a ton of gas cards and got my 5 back  next i figured out i would be clever and buy a ton of store gift cards grocery gift cards right at the end of the quarter then use those in the future to purchase gas cards  well i just tried that a couple days ago and discovered the store refuses to sell a gift card if youre paying with a gift card  so now im stuck with 1000 in grocery cards until i use them in actual grocery purchases haha one of the things about this grocery store is they partner with a gas station on their rewards program  they offer 10 cents off a gallon with every 100 spent in store and they double it to 20 cents off a gallon if you buy 100 in gift cards  then on the back of the receipt is a coupon for 10 cents off per gallon  which they double on tuesdays  unfortunately i think im one of the only people that takes this much advantage of the program   side note i actually just changed the billing cycle of my chase freedom card to end on the 24th of the month  that way i can charge a bunch of rewards in the final 67 days of the quarter  and if i have a 0 balance on the 24th my bill isnt due for 7 weeks  interest free  and chase freedom has never cared if you purchase gift cards with their quarterly rewards program  i also gave them a courtesy email giving the specific store and  amount that was going to be charged and of course they still called me with a fraud alert,0

ha  something i can answer  my thesis for my bachelor of political science is completely on dutch private military companies  in the current scientific terminology mercenaries are actually defined as contractors  calling them mercenaries was considered pretty old fashioned by the private military company directors i interviewed  contractors are defined as military personnel that do not work directly for a government but for a company  a lot of states  especially the us  have started to use these companies a lot over the last decades  in 2007 for example 54  of us defense personnel in afghanistan were contractors and not us state troops  contractors are deployed in a myriad of ways  they fight shoulder to shoulder with american soldiers in the front line but also protect vips or convoys  protect the outer rings of camps or support armies in logistical ways by flying planes or helicopters with vital supplies  they also guard merchant vessels in for example the gulf of aden and they help companies that have to deal with kidnappings of personnel in africa  contractors have advantages over normal troops in some situations  they are often cheaper to deploy than army equivalents  you do not want elite troops guarding the outer rings of camps in low intensity areas  so it is preferable for states to hire cheap third country contractors to do these relatively simple tasks so that the regular troops do not have to waste their time on patrol duties and can do actual missions  there is some criticisms on this system as some argue that companies should not partake in the monopoly of the use of legal force  this monopoly is the idea that only the state can legally detain you or punish you using force  now there are companies do basically the same  fighting wars for states makes it legal for them to kill people sometimes largely to their own discretion  the academic and philosophical debate on whether companies should be allowed to partake in this monopoly on the use of legal force is still raging and something we will have to tackle in the coming decades as the use of private military companies is on the rise  i hope i gave a quick am understandable overview of what pmcs do  i am sadly not with my computer so i ca nt give references for my sources  but if you want to learn more about pmcs authors like tonkin and leander are great sources to learn more about this emerging issue  they are typically formed by ex  military or police officers and are hired just like any other company  you d sign a contract with them  naturally  they do nt use the term  mercenary  preferring the more subtle term   security services   you would not hire these companies as an army to fight a war though  typically they would be contracted for personal security and to train an existing group of men  turning them into soldiers  they would also offer strategic counsel and probably have sources for supplying arms  mercenaries are just companies that provide people who do work  swiss mercenaries  employed by the vatican in an official capacity to guard the pope  are essentially an officially endorsed state sponsored mercenary arrangement  nepalese gurkhas who fight for the british army are something similar  but wholly private mercenaries basically grow out of some former soldier or someone with diplomatic and military connections who can hire people who are going to fight  ghaddafi hired chadian mercenaries essentially straight out of want ads in  well  chad  mark thatcher  son of former uk prime minister margaret  got into the business through simon mann  a former british army officer who was contracted by the angolan government to provide military services retaking an oil field  the legality of mercenaries is sort of all over the place  if the government of a country hires you to to do work for them  in their own country then presumably the work is by definition legal  at least in the sense that you took a contract you understood to be legal  using a mercenary force against another country is nt at all obvious when it is or is nt legal  in the case of say  colonial efforts by the americans in iraq  well  private contractors delivering supplies etc  need guards  so are those guys mercenaries   yes  but not necessarily   if you want to pay some french or americans or whatever to come to your country and train your army that is presumably legal  but if you want to pay them to come and train your insurgent force to take over the country that usually is nt  keep in mind that many countries  particularly in africa and the middle east have pathetically small armies  that have almost no equipment  no combat experience  no competent leadership  and generally ca nt be trusted to actually fight  or if they do  probably not win  those countries rely on foreign specialists for their fighting and training needs because they ca nt be bothered to train their own forces for the relatively rare event that they need them  so long as they are fighting non sovereign states  so pirates  gangs  insurgents  even isis  mercenaries are generally desirable  the situation against isis is a fairly good example of why you might need mercenaries  if you do nt trust your own army to not defect  you have a problem  syria and saudi have this problem   if you think your army is going to turn and run at the first sign of trouble you have a problem  the iraqi s have this problem   if your army refuses to fight during ramadan  you have a problem  mercenaries let you overcome a lot of that  also  mercenaries  are essentially outside the geneva conventions  they are not considered combatants and not entitled to geneva convention protections explicitly  for that reason they have no motivation to adhere to geneva conventions  and if you intend to do something illegal some mercenaries are happy to torture and stage coups etc  because it ca nt get any worse for them if they are caught and taken prisoner ,0
the little white sunrisesunset symbol on the thumbnail is a common representation of the sun in a clock face it is often used to indicate the time of day with the sunrise symbol representing the time when the sun is rising or the start of a new day usually around 600 am and the sunset symbol representing the time when the sun is setting or the end of a day usually around 600 pm the sunrisesunset symbols are usually only found on the thumbnail because it is the most convenient finger to use for this purpose as it is easy to see and easy to find on your hand other fingers do not typically have these symbols because they are not as easy to see or use for telling time,1

white holes are a theoretical concept in physics that is the opposite of a black hole a black hole is a region of space where gravity is so strong that nothing not even light can escape from it a white hole on the other hand is a region of space where matter and energy can only come out but nothing can go innnimagine a tunnel with one end leading into a black hole and the other end leading out of a white hole if something falls into the black hole it would be trapped there forever but if something came out of the white hole it would have come from the black holennwhite holes have never been observed and are purely theoretical at this point some scientists believe that they could exist but there is no solid evidence to support this idea,1

envy and jealousy are similar emotions but they have some differences both envy and jealousy involve wanting something that someone else has but envy is specifically about wanting something that someone else possesses while jealousy is about being worried that someone else will take something that you have for example if you see someone with a new car that you really want you might feel envy towards that person on the other hand if you have a partner and you see them talking to someone you are attracted to you might feel jealousy because you are worried that your partner will be taken away from you so while you could use the words interchangeably in some cases they do have slightly different meanings and connotations its important to be mindful of the specific emotion you are feeling and to communicate that accurately to others,1
hello  so chemically speaking  the term steroid i dictated a specific structure of a compound  chemical  all steroids are derived from cholesterol so they all have the same basic structure  what makes them different are what is  are attached to the structure  so steroids are differentiated into subclasses  they do things from stuff like anti  inflammatory  growth  help with breathing  hormone regulation  the mechanism for steroids are all pretty much the same believe it or not when you boil it down in that they act primarily as hormones  telling your body to produce something or to not produce something  there are a lot of different types of steroids  all variations on a basic theme  which has as its core 3 six  membered carbon rings and a five  membered carbon ring attached to each other in a specific orientation  the variations are additional carbon  oxygen atoms attached to the core   so they can work in different ways depending on their structure  however  most of those ways have to do with interfering with proliferation of your immune cells   b cells and t cells  macrophages  etc   this obviously reduces inflammation going on in your body  which can be life  saving  but on the flip side  the immune suppression can make you vulnerable to infection and cancer  which is why it s best not to administer them for prolonged periods if at all possible  steroids are an entire class of chemicals that may be naturally occurring or artificial  naturally occuring steroids are the chemicals used inside our bodies to regulate biological processes  artificial steroids are synthetic chemicals that act like the natural steroids so you re basically just sending a whole bunch of extra  signals  to do whatever it is that steroid controls ,0

in statistics and optimization errors and residuals are two closely related and easily confused measures of the deviation of an observed value of an element of a statistical sample from its true value not necessarily observable the error of an observation is the deviation of the observed value from the true value of a quantity of interest for example a population mean the residual is the difference between the observed value and the estimated value of the quantity of interest for example a sample mean the distinction is most important in regression analysis where the concepts are sometimes called the regression errors and regression residuals and where they lead to the concept of studentized residualsnin econometrics errors are also called disturbances,0

north korea is a country that is ruled by a government that is known for its strict control over its citizens and for its lack of respect for human rights the countrys leaders have been accused of many human rights violations including operating work camps or detention centers where prisoners are subjected to harsh conditions and mistreatment these camps are often referred to as political prison camps because many of the prisoners are believed to be political prisoners who have been imprisoned for expressing views that are critical of the government or for alleged crimes against the staternrnit can be difficult for other countries or organizations such as the united nations to intervene in situations like this because north korea is a sovereign state and has its own laws and government this means that it has the right to make its own decisions about how it treats its citizens and what kind of policies it wants to implement within its borders additionally north korea is known for being isolated from the rest of the world and for not allowing foreign observers or journalists to enter the country which makes it difficult to get accurate information about what is happening inside the countryrnrnwhile it is not easy to stop countries like north korea from committing human rights abuses there are steps that can be taken to try to hold them accountable and to raise awareness about the situation for example organizations such as amnesty international and human rights watch work to document human rights abuses and to advocate for change governments and international organizations can also try to pressure countries like north korea to respect human rights by imposing economic sanctions or by engaging in diplomatic efforts,1
when you play a record on a turntable the needle also called a stylus follows the grooves on the record and vibrates according to the music recorded on the record these vibrations are converted into electrical signals by the turntables cartridge the electrical signals are then sent to your speakers or receiver which amplify the signals and turn them back into sound waves that you can hear however even if your speakers or receiver are not turned on you can still hear the sound of the music being played on the turntable because the needle is vibrating and creating sound waves directly these sound waves travel through the air and can be heard by your ears even if they are not being amplified by speakers or a receiver so in this case the sound of the music is coming from the needle on the turntable and not from the speakers or receiver,1

there are a few reasons why gas prices in the us might be high one reason is that the cost of crude oil which is a major component of gasoline can fluctuate significantly when the cost of crude oil goes up it can lead to higher gas prices another reason is that gas prices can vary based on location some areas may have higher gas prices due to transportation costs taxes or other factors additionally gas prices can be affected by the level of demand for gasoline as well as the availability of oil and refining capacity finally some people may argue that oil companies can influence gas prices to some extent by controlling the amount of oil they produce and sell but its important to note that there are many other factors at play as well,1
arachnophobia or the fear of spiders is actually quite common its not exactly clear why this is but some experts think it might be because spiders can be very difficult to predict and control they can also be very fast and some of them can give bites that are painful or venomous evolution might also play a role in arachnophobia because in the past people who were afraid of spiders might have been more likely to avoid them and therefore more likely to survive and pass on their genes in other words the fear of spiders might have helped some of our ancestors to stay safe and so it became more common over time,1
good question one reason that box office records are reported in terms of money rather than just the number of tickets sold is because the value of money changes over time for example if a movie sold a million tickets in the year 2000 that would be considered a very successful run but if a movie sold a million tickets in 2021 it might not be as impressive because the cost of a movie ticket has likely increased since 2000 by reporting box office records in terms of money we can compare the success of different movies more accurately since the value of the money they earned is taken into accountanother reason that box office records are reported in terms of money is because its easier to compare the success of movies in different countries if a movie is released in multiple countries the number of tickets sold might be different in each country because of differences in population size but if we compare the total amount of money that the movie earned in each country we can get a better sense of how successful it was overalli hope that helps let me know if you have any other questions,1

train travel in the united states is not as popular as in other countries for a few reasons one reason is that the united states is a very large country with a lot of land and a relatively low population compared to some other countries this means that it can be more expensive to build and maintain a train system that covers such a large area another reason is that the united states has a welldeveloped system of roads and highways which makes it easy for people to travel by car many people in the united states own cars and are used to driving so they might not think as much about taking a train for shorter trips finally the united states has a relatively cheap and abundant supply of oil which makes it inexpensive to drive cars and fly on airplanes this means that people in the united states might be more likely to choose these forms of transportation over trains which can be slower and more expensive overall the combination of these factors has contributed to the fact that train travel is not as popular in the united states as in other countries,1

pure water is nt even a conductor  why would it be superconducting  at absolute zero perhaps where the definition of atoms and molecules break down  or the opposite  as a plasma  can you make water  plasma   water can be used with cobalt to create a cobalt oxide super conductor  or is you add water to graphite flakes they exhibit some super conductive properties  with water being polar  would nt that cause a lot of issues with all the magnetic fields created by super conductors  have a great day  electrical conduction is heavily influenced by the movement of free electrons  or electrons that are not used on bonding between atoms and are able to conduct  move from atom to atom   metallic materials such as copper and aluminum have a high amount of these free electrons  another effect on conduction is the 3d arrangement of atoms in a solid materials  certain arrangements allow for easier electron movement between atoms than others  energy is lost when these conducting electrons hit other atoms  dissipating energy  the dissipated heat is the observable heat generation in a wire due to resistance  superconducting occurs when electrons are actually attracted to each other allowing them to form pairs  normally electrons repel other electrons  but paired electrons act differently  which allows for zero energy dissipations during conduction  conduction in this case is of the electron pairs and not just individual electrons  so why not water  water forms a disorganized 3d orientation of molecules in solid state   superconducting occurs at very low temperatures  so i m assuming water is a solid   in a single water molecule  there are two hydrogens and and oxygen  of those two atoms  only oxygen has electrons that can conduct  but oxygen wants to hold onto these electrons and if the electrons where to conduct  there is not easy movement from one atom to another even as the special paired electrons  non  metallic materials that work as super conductors are highly ordered  easy to predict 3d arrangement of atoms  and contain metal ions such as the compound yttrium barium copper oxide which contains copper  in this ceramic material  conduction occurs with the copper  the wiki page on superconductivity is worth looking at  hope this helps ,0
power plants are designed to generate a certain amount of electricity to meet the demand for electricity from homes and businesses in a particular area the demand for electricity can change throughout the day so power plants need to be able to adjust how much electricity they produce in order to meet this changing demandnnpower plants do not constantly overproduce electricity to be safe instead they try to produce the right amount of electricity to meet the current demand if there is more electricity being produced than is needed the excess electricity is often sent back into the grid for other people to usennif there is not enough electricity to supply the grid power plants may try to increase their production of electricity to meet the demand if they are unable to do this the grid may experience a power outage which means that the electricity supply is temporarily shut off until the problem can be fixed,1

although digital information is made of 0s and 1s  the underlying medium is part of the real world  it s not digital  it s analog  so the different magnetic fields in a hard drive are not either uniformly  0  or  1   they are some amount that is interpreted by the hardware as 0 or 1 depending on how close they are to the design values  when you write a bit  you do nt just flip it to whatever value  it becomes the resultant of the field applied added to what was already there  with sensitive equipment  it is possible to  see  those differences  sensitive sensors  clever software can say  a  ha  this 0 seems to have been a 1 not too long ago   based on this  information can be deduced  reconstructed  the best bet is to rewrite the whole hd with random bits several times over  this averages out the differences and renders analysis difficult  impossible  edit  ok  before people start crucifying me  i am not claiming that this is a viable data recovery strategy or that it is useful in any way outside of a lab  i am just providing an eli5 for the underlying idea  personally  i simply destroy my old hard drives anyway  which is fast  simple  cheap  and leaves no room for speculation  edit 2  like this  url0 final edit  as shown in other replies to this post  this has been shown to not really be an issue  please read the other post  my reason for posting my original reply was to explain where the idea came from  not to claim anything about it  otoh i still maintain that destroying hard drives containing sensitive information when they reach end of life is still the safest thing to do  for one  i am entrusted with sensitive information about students in the college where i work  i am required to protect the data  shredding hard drives is faster and cheaper than the time  hardware  and labor required to delete them  it does nt  the notion that it takes multiple passes to securely erase a hdd is  fud   url0  based on a seminal paper from 1996 by peter gutmann  this seminal paper argued that it was possible to recover data that had been overwritten on a hdd based using magnetic force microscopy  the paper was purely hypothetical and was not based on any actual validation of the process  ie it has never even been attempted in a lab   the paper has never been corroborated  ie noone has attempted  or at least successfully managed to use this process to recover overwritten data even in a lab environment   furthermore  the paper is specific to technology that has not been used in hdds on over 15 years  furthermore  a  research paper   url2  has been published that refutes gutmanns seminal paper stating the basis is unfounded  this paper demonstrates that the probability of recovering a single bit is approximately 05   ie there s a 5050 chance that that bit was correctly recovered  and as more data is recovered the probability decreases exponentially such that the probability quickly approaches 0  ie in this case the probability of successfully recovering a single byte is 003  3 times successful out of 100 attempts  or recovering 10 bytes of info is 000000000000000059049impossible     source   url1  edit  sorry for the more r  askscience style answer  but  simply put  yes  writing all 0s is enough  or better still write random 1s and 0s edit3  a few users in this domain have passed on enough papers to point out that it is indeed possible to retrieve a percentage of contiguous blocks of data on lmr based drives  hdd writing method from the 90s   for modern drives its impossible  applying this to current tech is still fud  for those asking about ssds  this is a completely different kettle of fish  main issue with ssds is that they each implement different forms of  wear levelling   url4  depending on the controller  many ssds contain extra blocks that get substituted in for blocks that contain high number of wears  because of this you can not be guaranteed zeroing will overwrite everything  most drives now utilise  trim   url3   but this does not guarantee erasure of data blocks  in many cases they are simply marked as erased but the data itself is never cleared  for ssds its best to purchase one that has a secure delete function  or better yet  use full disk encryption  iirc it s something akin to a whiteboard  sure  you can erase a whiteboard  but sometimes you can still see what was previously written there  so  to fully  erase  it  you have to wipe it clean  write over it and then wipe it clean again ,0
to optimize the return on dividends you can follow these stepsdetermine your investment goals and risk tolerance your investment goals and risk tolerance will help you determine how much of your portfolio should be invested in dividendpaying stocks for example if you are looking for a steady stream of income and are willing to take on more risk you may want to allocate a larger portion of your portfolio to dividendpaying stocksresearch potential investments look for companies with a track record of steady or growing dividends consider factors such as the companys financial stability growth prospects and management quality you can also look for companies with a high dividend yield which is the annual dividend per share divided by the stock pricediversify your portfolio dont put all your eggs in one basket diversify your portfolio by investing in a variety of dividendpaying stocks in different sectors and industries this will help reduce risk and increase the chances of earning a steady stream of incomemonitor your investments keep track of your investments and the dividends they are paying be aware of any changes in the companys financial performance or dividend policy as this could affect your return on dividendsreview your portfolio regularly periodically review your portfolio to ensure it aligns with your investment goals and risk tolerance if necessary make adjustments to optimize your return on dividendsits important to note that investing in stocks carries risks and you should always do your due diligence before making any investment decisions its also a good idea to consult with a financial advisor or professional for personalized advice,1
the water is constantly recycled  so it does nt matter how much you use  more water creates a better flow  especially since americans take huge shits source  clogged toilets many times there are two  different designs   url0  siphonic and wash down   bowl size siphonic flushing requires a bigger elongated bowl to fill water properly to flush compared to the compact version of the wash down  most europeans prefer the space  saving models whilst elongated versions are preferred in the united states  thus  us type toilets to siphonic and european toilets to wash down   water saving wash down toilets is usually equipped with a dual flushing mechanism that can accommodate 3 or 6 gallons per flush for solid or liquid waste  in contrast  siphonic toilets require 6 gallons or more to flush properly  some countries even mandate 45 gallon flush capacity   dual flushing is not advisable for siphonic systems   trapway siphonic has a greater tendency to clog due to the smaller trapway  since wash down does not need this suction  it has a larger trapway but leaves less water on the bowl after flushing compared to the half full of the siphonic version  splashing sometimes occurs when solid waste hits the water for wash down versions  this can be minimized by placing a piece of toilet paper over the water   spare parts and maintenance over time  because of the impurities of our water  silicon or rubber washers for both toilets need to be changed   water seepage will occur  a wash down toilet has top button flush  abs plastic float valve and flush valve which rarely need replacement   siphonic type usually comes with the side lever  abs plastic float valve and flush valve  some versions have a float ball and chain which need to be replaced more often   replacement parts are generally sold in major hardware stores    cleaning depending on the holes around the bowl rim where the water comes out  some wash down toilets tend to have â€œ water marks â€  duravit â€™s special coating called â€œ wondergliss â€ is a solution for this problem  this special coating will last for quite sometime as long as no harsh chemicals or solutions are used in cleaning the bowl   europeans therefore prefer having a toilet brush as a part of their bath accessories over the plunger that is more for the clogging of a siphonic toilet  so make sure you buy a good quality siphonic toilet or you end up having the same maintenance issue of malls where they throwing tissue papers in the bowl is discouraged    tldr   european style ones sometimes leave marks on the bowl  usa style ones sometimes clog and flood the room  we do nt have bidets  so we need to make a giant splash to help clean our chocolate starfish ,0
i m not sure of the exact group  i believe it was the celtics  pagans  they would bring a piece of evergreen trees into their home during the winter seasons as a reminder that spring would come back around  in early paganism  evergreen trees were brought indoors to give spirits a warm place to rest while it was cold outside  that s why cranberries  popcorn etc  were stung on it  a star decorated the top because a star is the pagan symbol for the elements  air  earth  water  fire  and spirit  soul   traditionally candles were placed in the tree too for light and warmth but i do nt know how that was nt extremely dangerous  good thing electric lights are available now  though  it was co opted from one of the pagan holidays that happened around the same time  there are traces of the tradition in the yule  the norse holiday  and saturnalia  the roman holiday ,0
international waters refer to areas of the ocean that are not under the jurisdiction of any particular country these areas are also known as the high seas or the law of the sea in general international waters are considered to be beyond the territorial jurisdiction of any nation and are subject to the laws of the flag state the country whose flag the ship is flying nif you commit a crime such as murder in international waters it can be difficult to determine which country has the authority to investigate and prosecute the crime in some cases the flag state may have jurisdiction while in other cases the country where the victim is a citizen may also have jurisdiction nif you commit a crime in international waters it is possible that you may be able to get away with it depending on the circumstances and the ability of law enforcement to investigate and prosecute the crime however it is important to note that international law provides for cooperation between countries to ensure that crimes committed at sea are properly investigated and prosecuted nin general it is always important to follow the laws of the country you are in and to respect the rights and safety of others,1
usually the reason is lack of moisture  when you blink  your eyelid  smears  a tear film over the surface of your eye  due to some situations andor diseases  this tear film breaks up  evaporates  much faster than it normally should  and leaves the surface of your eye exposed  this causes the gritty  scratchy feeling in your eye  this is why you feel the need to blink more  usually a dry eye will rub on the inside of the eye lid  this will aggravate the membrane covering the eye called the conjunctiva  this becomes swollen as fluid builds up beneath the membrane  moving your eye around in its socket causes the bulging conjunctiva to thicken and press against the eye lid  causing the sensation there is a foreign body in the eye  if you also get something in your eye and then rub it  it can cause a scratch on the cornea  tearing and blinking can remove the debris  but the scratch itself can make it feel like the debris is still there  this is why it is advised to not rub your eyes when you get something in them ,0
when ice cream is made it is churned while it is freezing to incorporate air and make it smooth and creamy this is what gives ice cream its soft fluffy texture however when ice cream is left in the freezer for an extended period of time it can become hard and icy this is because the water in the ice cream starts to separate from the other ingredients and forms into ice crystals these ice crystals make the ice cream hard and icy instead of smooth and creamyrnrnone way to prevent ice cream from becoming hard and icy is to store it in an airtight container this will help keep the ice cream fresh and prevent it from picking up odors or flavors from other foods in the freezer additionally it is a good idea to let the ice cream sit out at room temperature for a few minutes before scooping it as this can help make it easier to scoop and give it a softer texture,1
phantom limb syndrome is a condition in which a person feels pain sensation or movement in a limb that is no longer there this can happen after an amputation or a spinal cord injurynnone way that mirrors can be used to help with phantom limb syndrome is through a treatment called mirror therapy in mirror therapy a person sits in front of a mirror and moves their healthy limb at the same time they imagine moving their phantom limb the reflection of the healthy limb in the mirror creates the illusion that the phantom limb is also moving this can help to reduce the sensation of pain in the phantom limbnnits important to note that mirror therapy is just one treatment option for phantom limb syndrome and it may not work for everyone other treatments such as medication and physical therapy may also be helpful in managing the pain and discomfort associated with this condition,1
sure waterjet cutting is a process that uses a highpressure stream of water mixed with an abrasive material to cut through different materials this is done by using a machine that shoots out the water at very high speeds kind of like how a hose shoots out water when you turn it on full blastthe water is mixed with an abrasive material like sand or tiny bits of metal to help it cut through hard materials like metal or stone the water and abrasive mixture is shot out through a small hole in a nozzle and it cuts through the material like a saw bladewaterjet cutting is used to cut through a variety of materials including metal plastic stone and even food its a very precise way to cut materials and it doesnt create a lot of heat or dust which makes it a clean and safe processi hope that helps let me know if you have any other questions,1
terrorist attacks are often carried out with the intention of spreading fear and causing chaos some people who carry out terrorist attacks do it because they believe that it will help further their cause whatever that may be for example they might believe that by causing fear and chaos they can pressure a government to make changes that they want however most people would agree that terrorism is never a justifiable means to an end and that there are much better ways to try to bring about positive change,1
well you might take a minor hit to your credit score this is snapshot of my credit utilization written for an article on my site the point there was that zero card use actually dinged the score but for you going over the 20 level is the risk its not too large a hit depending how high the utilization goes id not lose sleep over it kind of you to help,0
at a certain pressure  the nitrogen in the air you breath is absorbed into your blood  this happens when you go diving  because the deeper you go  the higher the pressure  the more nitrogen you absorb  when you ascend too quickly  enough nitrogen comes out of your blood as a gas in your arteries and veins to block circulation  which can kill you  the idea behind safety stops is that you give the nitrogen enough time to come out of your bloodstream so that it does nt form bubbles in your circulatory system  that s the general idea  but i m not sure about the exact details for how nitrogen actually forms bubbles that kill you  edit   solubility chart for nitrogen   url0  edit  yaaashs post about lungs is a good point too going to restate what others have said with boyles law  boyles law states that p1v1  p2v2  in other words  pressure is inversely proportiomal to volume  as pressure increases  the gas gets compressed so the volume decreases  it applies to this case when we look at the other side of the law  that when pressure decreases  the volume of the gas increases  so if you are 200 feet underwater  there is going to be a ton of pressure on that gas  so it will compress  if you rise up to the surface very quickly  the pressure will decrease fast enough for your body to be unable to respond properly to the change  and therefore the gas will expand in the same manner  which obviously can cause some serious problems for your health  people explained the bends already  but in addition to that  there is a risk of overinflation of the lungs  when you take in a deep breath underwater  your lungs inflate completely  as you ascend to the surface  the pressure decreases  and as a result  the volume of air in your lungs increases  if the volume of air in the lungs increases faster than you can exhale  the lungs can overinflate and then rupture  this is why you never hold your breath while diving  and always exhale while surfacing ,0
there are many theories out there but newton s and einstein s theories are the most widely accepted  newton  theory of universal gravitation gravity is a predictable force that acts on all matter in the universe  it is a function of mass and distance  each particle of matter attracts every other particle with a force directly proportional to the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them  basically  the closer the objects are  the stronger the gravitational pull they exert on each other  this theory means that planets at starts hundreds light years away would still exert a gravitational force on earth  just a very  very small one  einstein  general theory of relativity gravity is not a force  but a curve in space time  example  basic physics states that if no external force is at work  an object will always travel in the straightest possible line  so let s take a ball flying in space above the earth in a straight line  if earth was not there  the ball would continue in a straight line  however  the earth causes a distortion  or bend in the plane along which the ball is traveling  according to einstein this object will travel along the straightest possible line  but due to a distortion in space time  the straightest possible line is now along a spherical path  so the ball that was once moving along a flat plane in moving along a spherical plane  which causes it to  fall  by moving down that path on the spherical bend towards the earth  hope that makes sense  no  we do not  we can explain how gravity reacts within mass but we do not know how to explain how or why it functions  the graviton is a hypothetical partical in quantum physics that has no mass but extends stress  energy to mass due to its spin  so far  scientists have not been able to confirm nor deny the existence of gravitons  do nt worry though  they re working on it  for now  it is simply an accepted law of physics  even though we do not have proof of the  cause   we re not quite sure what gravity is  we have theories  of course  light  and electromagnetic radiation is general  from infrared to gamma radiation  manifests itself as photons  it s postulated that there s a similar  likewise massless particle which conveys the force of gravity  called  graviton   we have nt observed them  but the math does check out ,0
electricity wants to go to the ground because it is looking for a place to go where it can be used up or discharged think of it like water flowing through a pipe the water wants to flow out of the pipe and into the ground just like electricity wants to flow out of a circuit and into the ground the ground is a good place for electricity to go because it is a conductor which means it can allow electricity to flow through it the dirt rocks and decaying organic matter in the ground are actually not very good conductors of electricity but they are still good enough for electricity to flow through when electricity flows through the ground it can be used up by things like lightning or the electric circuits in our homes and buildings,1
so you do nâ€™t aspirate and get pneumonia or die  the anesthetic cocktail they give you causes paralysis which relaxes the pyloric sphincter and can allow reflux of whatever you ate or drank prior to surgery one of the many problems which can happen with anesthesia is that you can vomit while unconscious  this is a problem in the best of circumstances but if you have eaten something there is a lot more to be thrown up  and the danger is that you will then breath this vomit into your lungs  that makes a bad situation   really   bad  and given that it is fairly easy to reduce the danger simply by not eating prior to the operation that is standard practice  people already answered  but fun fact  that s one reason they ll push on your throat if you ve seen anyone go under  it s called crycoid pressure  and it s a twofer allowing visualisation for intubation and to close up the esophagus to prevent vomiting ,0
the scandinavian countries of norway sweden and finland all have their own separate languages because they have a long history of being independent nations with their own unique cultures and traditionsnnnorwegian swedish and finnish are all part of the germanic language family which means they are closely related and have some similarities however they are also quite distinct from each other and have evolved differently over timennone reason for these differences is that the scandinavian countries have had different histories and have been influenced by different cultures and languages for example sweden has been influenced by its neighbors denmark and germany while finland has been influenced by its neighbor russiannanother reason for the differences between the scandinavian languages is that the countries have developed their own written languages and systems of spelling and grammar this has helped to preserve the unique characteristics of each language and make it distinct from the othersnnso even though the scandinavian countries are all located close to each other and share many cultural similarities they each have their own unique language that reflects their distinct histories and cultures,1
communism is a type of government in which everyone in the society shares their resources and wealth the idea is that everyone works together and shares what they have so that everyone has enough to meet their needs in theory communism sounds like a good idea because everyone has access to the things they need and no one goes without however in practice communism has not worked very well one reason it has not been successful is because it is difficult to figure out how to fairly distribute resources and wealth among everyone in the society another reason is that people may not be motivated to work hard if they know that they will not be rewarded for their efforts additionally in some communist countries the government has had a lot of control over peoples lives and has not allowed people to speak out or express their opinions freely this can lead to a lack of freedom and individual rights which many people consider to be very important overall communism has had some successes and some failures but it has generally not been as successful as other types of government in providing for the needs and desires of the people,1
dogs live in packs  so they are more willing to listen to the leader of the pack  ie  the person   cats usually live more solitary lives  so they do not respond as readily to external command  in addition to what moskau said  dogs have also been bred over tens of thousands of years to be more useful to humans  cats have nt really been pushed in the same direction  we need to be clear out one thing up front  both are acting out of self interest  cats are often described or depicted as selfish  but the reality is that  both  are selfish  as pretty much all animals are  they just pursue their selfish goals  what they  want  or feel they need  in different ways  which humans then translate into what they recognise superficially as apparently similar human motives and behaviours  in fact  however  both dogs and cats are doing essentially the same thing  and our impressions that they re different are mistaken  what dogs want  pack membership  which means your approval  this is what their instincts tell them is the surest way to secure safety  comfort  and food  as pack leader  you control the food  and because you control the food  as well as shelter  you control them  but the dog s loyalty to you is not out of altruism  a trait that even most humans do nt have  it s out of an urge to win and maintain their membership in your pack  in order to secure the things they need  what cats want  safety  comfort  and food  yes  they want the same things  they just follow a less socially circuitous route to it  anyone who has a cat can tell you that just like dogs  they use emotional cues to get the things from you that they desire  but desire for your intimate companionship  touching you  being pet  talked to  and so on  varies more from cat to cat than it does from dog to dog  dogs  pack instincts are strong  making them inherently more social  both to each other and to humans  cats are social in a different way  and usually less so with each other  and often with only one or a few humans  that does not mean that they re  less   friendly   only that they do not feel the need to maintain the same tight organisational bonds that dogs usually do  the main difference between the two is the approximately 20000  year difference between when we first domesticated them  dogs have been with us for at least 40000 years  cats probably less than half that  cats need time to catch up  that s all  they have nt learned all the same tricks that dogs have regarding social interaction  but i assure you  both want the same things from us ,0
lasers  you take a few lasers pointed in from different angles and have them cross at a single point  individually they do nt have enough power to damage the material but they do when you cross multiple beams they re called  sub  surface laser engravings   url0  or bubblegrams  when doing laser engraving  typically they focus the laser on the surface of the material  it creates a microscopic fracture  with glass  crystal  and certain plastics  you can focus the laser below the surface  this causes the microfracture to occur deep within the glass itself  not just at the surface  by adjusting the focus depth  as well as the x and y coordinates of the laser  a 3d engraving can be made  hmm i would have thought they were a special kind of laser  ultrafast lasers  or femtosecond lasers  they have extremely short pulses with huge amounts of peak power  unlike  normal  lasers that machine or mill material away by boiling and vaporising  these lasers machine or mill by  cold ablation   the huge light field power frees the electrons  then it becomes opaque  so absorbs more light  so it frees more electrons  then it becomes more opaque etc etc  eventually there is no more electrons holding the material together  and it just explodes  it s just that it happens in a tiny scale  if you look at it with a microscope  it s an absolute mess ,0
well  written fiction puts us into the frame of mind of the protagonist  it shows us the world from their point of view  and draws us into it  from a neutral  third party standpoint  antiheroes and criminals are awful people who need to be stopped  but from their own perspective  they re just doing what they need to do  in good fiction  we see things their way  but an argument can be made for the reverse  here s an example of what i mean  suppose that there was a terrorist  someone who bombs government buildings  attacks security guards  and disappears without a trace  imagine if suddenly  that person gained super powers  and pledged to transport the human race from this world into an apocalyptic hellscape of war and survival  that person is neo  from our perspective  the matrix is like 1000 times better  but from his it has to end  the movies draw us into his perception  but a neutral third party would disagree  that s part of what makes the movie great  it forces us to imagine and identify with a truly alien proposition  that was  in fact  the entire point of what made the show dexter interesting  they tried to make an incredibly sick and twisted serial killer relatable  and they did a good job  the people he actually murdered were even more sick and twisted than he was  so it caused conflict with people who knew what he was doing was wrong  but still wanted him to do it  the real life monsters have fan clubs too  usually full of adoring women offering themselves up as brides  honestly  it s creepy but  hybristophilia   url0  is real ,0
selfdriving cars use a variety of sensors to gather information about their environment including the road surface these sensors can include cameras radar and lidarone way that a selfdriving car can determine the amount of friction on the road surface is by using its sensors to measure the speed and direction of the car and then comparing this information to how the car is actually accelerating or braking for example if the car is trying to brake but is not slowing down as quickly as it should this could indicate that the road surface has low friction such as if it is icy or wetanother way that a selfdriving car can recognize ice or wet surfaces is by using its sensors to detect the presence of water or ice on the road for example a camera or radar sensor might be able to see the reflection of water on the road surface or a lidar sensor might be able to detect the presence of ice crystals in the airoverall selfdriving cars use a combination of sensors and sophisticated algorithms to gather and interpret information about the road surface and adjust their driving accordingly this helps them to navigate safely and efficiently even in challenging weather conditions,1
ancient map makers had to rely on a combination of their own observations information from other travelers and explorers and their own interpretations of the world around them they used a variety of methods to try to accurately depict the shapes of continents and other land masses including using instruments like compasses and sextants to measure angles and distances and using landmarks like mountains and rivers as reference points they also used written accounts from other people who had explored different parts of the world and incorporated that information into their maps some ancient map makers were more accurate than others and over time as more information became available the shapes of the continents became more accurately depicted on maps,1
the black swan theory is a concept in risk management that refers to events or occurrences that are unexpected and have a significant impact the term is derived from the metaphor of a black swan which refers to a hypothetical event that is unexpected and has a significant impact but is also retrospectively explainablennnnthe black swan theory was popularized by nassim nicholas taleb in his book the black swan the impact of the highly improbable in which he argues that black swan events are not only highly impactful but also difficult to predict or anticipate according to taleb black swan events are characterized by their rarity their extreme impact and the fact that they are often only explainable in hindsightnnnnthe black swan theory has important implications for risk management and decisionmaking as it suggests that we should be prepared for and able to adapt to unexpected and potentially catastrophic events it also highlights the importance of being aware of our own biases and limitations when it comes to predicting and managing risk and the need to be open to the possibility that events or outcomes that we consider unlikely or impossible may actually occur,1

preferred shares typically have a fixed dividend rate and do not have the same potential for capital appreciation as common stock this is because the value of common stock is largely determined by the performance of the company and can fluctuate significantly based on changes in the market or the companys financial performance in contrast the value of preferred shares is more stable and is not as closely tied to the performance of the company as a result preferred shares may not offer the same potential for capital gain as common stockits important to note that preferred shares can still offer some potential for capital appreciation if the companys financial performance improves and the value of the preferred shares increases as a result however this potential is generally limited compared to that of common stock additionally preferred shares may offer some degree of downside protection in the event that the companys performance deteriorates as the fixed dividend provides a level of income that is not dependent on the companys profitability,1
spiders are stationary for a long time because they are waiting for their prey to come to them many spiders spin webs to catch insects or other small animals to eat they build their webs in a place where they think they will be able to catch a lot of food and then they just wait they dont have to move around to find food because they have set up their own restaurant where the food comes to them spiders are also able to go for long periods of time without eating because they dont need very much food they can survive on just a few insects a week so they are able to wait patiently for their next meal to come along,1

i do nt remember where i read this  but it gave this description of dealing with bears  black bears   as many in this thread have said  be loud and agressive  they can usually be scared off  grizzlies  play dead  you may get mauled a bit and scratched by claws  but hopefully still alive  the grizzlie mostly wants to show dominence and will get bored  polar  might as well try to fight  but you re pretty much screwed  polar bears are used to being the biggest thing around and see everything else as prey  run  they ll chase you down and then eat you  play dead  they ll walk over and eat you sooner  so  might as well go down fighting  eli5  i see all the play dead comments on here and need to interject one point  this is not  play dead  like telling your dog to play dead  this is playing dead as in curling up into a ball and keeping yourself face down as your back will be the toughest part of your body for the bear to claw through  when it tries to role you over or shift you in any way you must move yourself back to being face down  going along with this people have made the point that this is for brown bearsincluding grizzly  kodiak  etc    but only once they have actually started attacking you is it necessary  before an attack has occurred  and you have stumbled across a single bear that is close to you should you make yourself as big as possible  wave your arms  jump up and down  and sing a song at the top of your lungs  this will typically discourage the bear from coming near you  again  as pointed out elsewhere this is not applicable to black bears as they will just keep attacking no matter what  focus on repeatedly striking them in the nose as hard and as fast as you can until they relent  the only thing you can predict about bears is that they will be unpredictable  they have personalities as unique as humans and all will act a little differently although they do have traits  do nt startle them black or brown  never get near a cub with mama bear around  look large but non threatening as you back away slowly  most charges are false charges and standing tall  jacket or shirt held high for size and yelling should call their bluff  in their home  carry pepper spray and make noise  in heavy griz country  few guns will save you  large cal  like 44 mag or 454 casull  shotgun with slugs  45  70 etc  sourse  alaskan village raised,0

to mix  some force needs to actually mix them  if the two liquids  yes  they are both water  but there s other stuff in there too  and they can be different temperatures too  then the denser one will stay on the bottom and the less dense one on top since it would float  this is a little complicated to explain  but it can also be entirely based on water trajectory  there are lines and surfaces in a dynamical system  like fluid flow  some of them are strong attractors or repellers  and the strong repellers can act as a barrier to transport  so if two distinct bodies of water  varying chemistry  density  straddle a barrier like this it can take a long time for the water to mix  and you ll be able to see the separation  they re called lagrangian coherent structures if you re interested and the wikipedia page is pretty good  url0 another place to view such a phenomenon in a rather more mute way but in a more livable climate  is from the top of cape point near cape town south africa ,0

before the widespread use of the internet people typically purchased airline tickets in one of several ways here are a few examplesnnby phone many airlines had a phone number that you could call to book a flight you would provide the necessary information such as your destination the dates you wanted to travel and the number of tickets you needed and a representative would help you book the flightnnin person you could also go to the airport or a travel agency to purchase a ticket in person this might be a good option if you wanted to ask questions or get help with your travel plansnnby mail some airlines allowed you to send in a request for tickets by mail you would fill out a form and send it to the airline along with a check or money order to pay for the ticketsnnoverall it was usually possible to purchase tickets in advance for future travel although you might have had to plan ahead if you wanted to book a flight that was very far in the future such as 23 months,1
carrying extra weight doesnt necessarily make you stronger because muscles need to be actively trained in order to become stronger just carrying around extra weight doesnt give your muscles the type of stimulation they need to grow and become strongerrnrnthink of it like this if you want to get better at running you need to practice running just walking around all the time isnt enough to make you a better runner similarly if you want to get stronger you need to do exercises that challenge and stimulate your muscles to growrnrnits also worth noting that being overweight or obese can actually make it harder for some people to do certain exercises which can make it more difficult for them to build strength its important for everyone to maintain a healthy weight and take care of their bodies through exercise and a healthy diet,1
they do nt  decorating eggs seems to be a festive activity dating back to antiquity  the rabbit  or the hare  was a common symbol in christianity  and european culture in general  the practice seems to come from german protestants  who rejected the catholic practice of fasting during easter in favour of continuing to dye and eat eggs  given that eggs were prohibited during lent  this also made them significantly cheaper  so it has a semi  practical explanation  like a lot of things  german practices came into english practice through the royal family  which was  imported  from germany in the 17th century  when george i ascended to the british throne  you might ask why did easter turned into a christian holiday  celebrating  the torture and death of their god when it is actually  and originally  about the spring equinox and fertility  like every christian holiday it is actually a pagan holiday that predates the invention of jesus  the eggs and the bunny are symbols of fertility that have absolutely nothing to do with christianity  they come from the festival of ishtar  an ancient pagan festival that was folded into christianity by constantine ,0
the rotation of the motor must be transmitted to the rotation of the wheels  what the clutch does is connect the rotation of the engine with the rotation of the wheels  inside the car you have several gears with dog teeth connected to one another  like this   url0   the engine is rotating  makes the green  and inevitably the red and the blue  turn  but the blue are turning blind  they are not connected to the yellow rod  if your engine is off and you re rolling downhill  the yellow rod rotates  but all the gears are still  the yellow rod is only connected to the purple and it s what makes the wheels of your car turn  with the clutch and the knob you can move the purple and attach it to whatever you need  when the purple is attached  you have a direct connection between the engine and the yellow rod  and eventually  the wheels   the reverse has an additional gear  so the rotation of the engine is transmitted backwards to the wheels  and gears work in the same way as in a bike  you can pedal a lot  high rpm  but get not a lot of displacement for all the pedaling you re putting in  or pedal less and make the engine  you  more effective  now  on a bike you usually choose to be less tired  pedal a lot  at the end of the day  but in a car you re looking for the most effective and less fuel consuming gear  clutch engages and disengages the wheels from the transmission  you press the clutch in to disengage the transmission and then put the gear shifter to whatever gear you want  and then release the clutch to re  engage the transmission  then you can press the gas pedal and zoom zoom  usually in first gear you have to press the gas as you release the clutch in a seesaw motion so that you do nt stall out  you have to learn at what point the clutch engages  somewhere in the middle of the pedal push  and match the rpm for when you change gears  so that the transition is smooth and does nt stress your car  these are usually what people have a hard time with but the mechanism itself is simple  the shifting knob controls a set of gears in your transmission  and the clutch is basically the  lock  for those  so when you engage the clutch  you unlock your transmission  that allows you to shift to different gears  shifting is controlled by your knob  of course  those gears control a portion of your engine as well  they basically keep it turning and running in simple terms  so when you hear of someone  stalling out  their engine shut down because there was nt anything turning it over  hope this helps  i also understand this is remotely the most simplistic explanation of a manual transmission on the internet  haha ,0
value for sports team is a bit different than standard businesses  a regular business is often valued by calculating what that business has made relatively recently  is currently making  and is likely to make in the near future  sports teams  and maybe some other businesses  also go up in value due to less than tangible reasons  for major sports teams  you just ca nt start one  you have to buy an existing one or petition the league to add a team  adding a team to a major sports league is not an easy feat  the perceived value of a sports team could be  x on paper but that s when it s not really on the market  just putting it up for sale increases the potential value because of how unique that event can be  tldr because major teams rarely go up for sale and that rareness dramatically increases the purchase price  i wonder if the purchaser is not eyeing the team purchased  more they populous around the team  i wonder if the purchaser envisions the local population of the clippers to have a economic boom  with an economic boom  people will have much more money  with more money they will spend more to see sports games and buy 10 dollar sodas  so if there were a place to invest in a locality  look around where the clippers are  values are entirely speculative until someone actually pays it  that s what determines a value  until that happens  people just try to guesstimate what someone will pay  sometimes that estimate is wrong ,0
its normal to have thoughts that come into your mind that you cant seem to shake sometimes these thoughts can be about something that is bothering you or that you are worried about other times they might be about something that you are very interested in or excited aboutone reason that you might not be able to stop thinking about something is because it is important to you in some way for example if you are worried about a problem at work you might keep thinking about it because you want to find a solution if you are excited about a new hobby you might keep thinking about it because it brings you joyanother reason that you might not be able to stop thinking about something is because you have a lot of emotional attachment to it for example if you are grieving the loss of a loved one you might find yourself thinking about them a lot because you miss them and are trying to come to terms with their absencein general it can be hard to control your thoughts because they are a natural part of your minds functioning however there are things that you can do to try to redirect your thoughts and focus on something else such as practicing mindfulness or distracting yourself with a different activity it can also be helpful to talk to someone about your thoughts as this can help you gain perspective and find ways to manage them,1

a cars fuel efficiency or mileage is the distance it can travel on a single tank of gas when a car is driving at a faster speed it requires more energy to maintain that speed this energy comes from the cars engine which burns fuel to create the necessary power the faster the car is moving the more fuel it needs to burn to maintain that speed which means it will have lower fuel efficiency on the other hand when a car is driving at a slower speed it requires less energy to maintain that speed this means that it will burn less fuel which leads to better fuel efficiency so the reason a car does not get better mileage when it is driving at a faster speed is because it is using more fuel to maintain that speed hope that helps,1

captain america whose real name is steve rogers is considered the first avenger because he was the first character to appear in the marvel cinematic universe mcu which is a series of movies and tv shows based on marvel comics characters in the first mcu movie captain america the first avenger we see steve rogers become captain america during world war ii this movie takes place before the other movies in the mcu so captain america is considered the first avenger chronologically in the comics captain america was also one of the original avengers along with iron man thor the hulk and antman who later became giantman these characters came together to form the avengers in order to fight against threats that no single hero could handle on their own so in this sense captain america was also the first avenger in terms of the teams formation i hope that helps let me know if you have any other questions,1

in mathematics and computer algebra automatic differentiation ad also called algorithmic differentiation computational differentiation autodifferentiation or simply autodiff is a set of techniques to evaluate the derivative of a function specified by a computer program ad exploits the fact that every computer program no matter how complicated executes a sequence of elementary arithmetic operations addition subtraction multiplication division etc and elementary functions exp log sin cos etc by applying the chain rule repeatedly to these operations derivatives of arbitrary order can be computed automatically accurately to working precision and using at most a small constant factor more arithmetic operations than the original programnautomatic differentiation is distinct from symbolic differentiation and numerical differentiation nsymbolic differentiation faces the difficulty of converting a computer program into a single mathematical expression and can lead to inefficient code numerical differentiation the method of finite differences can introduce roundoff errors in the discretization process and cancellation both of these classical methods have problems with calculating higher derivatives where complexity and errors increase finally both of these classical methods are slow at computing partial derivatives of a function with respect to many inputs as is needed for gradientbased optimization algorithms automatic differentiation solves all of these problems,0
the moon doesnt crash into the earth because it is held in orbit around the earth by the force of gravity imagine the moon and the earth are two balls attached to a string if you swing one ball around in a circle the other ball will stay in place because it is attached to the string in the same way the earths gravity is like the string that keeps the moon in orbit around the earthnnthe moon doesnt fall to the earth because it is moving fast enough that the force of gravity is not strong enough to pull it down the moon is constantly falling towards the earth but it is also constantly moving forward this means it never actually reaches the surface of the earth instead it falls around the earth in a circular path like a ball on a stringnnon the other hand the moon wouldnt float away because it is being pulled towards the earth by the force of gravity if the moon were to float away it would have to be moving fast enough to escape the earths gravity however the moon is not moving fast enough to escape the earths gravity so it stays in orbit around the earth,1

well for starters dopamine is a neurotransmitter  it s not something that travels through the bloodstream  and likely would nt be able to pass through the blood  brain barrier either  a sort of biological gate  keeper for the brain   neurotransmitters like dopamine have many  many different functions in different parts of the nervous system  dopamine is a very prevalent one  and has important functions such as fine motor control and cognition in addition to what we associate it with   reward    it is an incredibly complex system that depends just as much on where in the nervous system a certain chemical is released and the combination with other chemicals  as much as any particular chemical itself  using drugs does trigger a release of dopamine in something called the mesolimbic reward pathway  this is one of the major causes the euphoria and eventual addiction associated with drugs such as cocaine and opiates  however  the mechanism and pathway that triggers this release is very complex  and involves many other simultaneous processes  long story short  dopamine is just one part of a very complex system  and only has the stereotypical effects in very specific circumstances  not only is dopamine a neurotransmitter it is also a powerful vasoconstrictor  we use it intravenously in the hospital to increase the blood pressure in critically ill patients  it can also be use in place of a external pacemaker because it will also raise the heart rate  it is also bad if you inject it and goes into the interstitial space  outside the vein   it cause tissue necrosis  necrosis bad unless you did nt want that skin ,0

from what i understand when something is live  it s not actually completely live  there is a delay and i think it ranges from 10  20 seconds  this is so they can catch anything that happens and quickly edit it out  i do nt think this is always the case but it does happen  this also gives time for people to quickly type the cc  also  you ll notice in live events that the cc is typically behind what is actually happening  they do nt line up with what is being said  this is also a result of people typing the cc  if you re wondering how people can type that fast  they use what s called a  stenotype   url0   these are the things you see in courts that people are typing on  they allow the operators to type upwards of 200 words per minute  edit  who won the bet  there was a bbc special on this and they have speech recognition software  at the point you might think the software just catches what s being said and a human supervises but no  where there is a live show like a football game  there is a man in a room repeating word for word what we hear on tv  that is called respeaking  enunciating every single bit so the software is recognising his voice and not that of the broadcaster  at the same time  this same guy checks the texts and validates it for broadcast    edit   i found the link  url0 on most live broadcasts the cc comes from two sources  they can be typed in live by a person like a stenographer or the scripts that are being used can feed the cc  often times there is a combination of the two  there are actually companies that specialize in doing live cc  they listen to the show over telephone  internet and the typed information is fed back to the tv station and inserted into their broadcast signal  i know that some tv stations in utah use a service that is located in colorado  by the way  most live tv is not on a delay with a kill switch  its just too complicated to do things that way  if it s a call  in show or something with a lot of audience participation they might delay the signal  but it is rare  usually we just take our chances  there is a delay that is caused by all the signal processing  the cc for example   but that builds up after the signal leaves the control room  so it does nt help with censorship ,0

the rods and cones in your eye are lightsensitive cells that help you see they are located in a layer at the back of your eye called the retina when light enters your eye it passes through the cornea the clear front part of your eye and the pupil the black circle in the center of your eye the light then hits the retina which sends a signal to your brain through the optic nerve your brain processes the signal and interprets it as an image the rods and cones in your eye are responsible for detecting different wavelengths of light and sending this information to your brain the rods are more sensitive to low levels of light and are responsible for helping you see in low light conditions while the cones are responsible for helping you see color and fine detail the reason that the image in the url you provided appears to move and change when you look at it is because of an optical illusion called the photon wave function collapse this illusion is created by the interaction of the lightsensitive cells in your eye with the patterns and colors in the image when you look at the image your brain is trying to interpret the patterns and colors but it is unable to do so because the patterns and colors are constantly changing this causes your brain to perceive the image as moving and changing even though it is actually still,1

prostitution also known as sex work is the exchange of sexual services for money or other forms of payment some people believe that prostitution is recessionproof because they think that people will always want and be willing to pay for sexual services even during times of economic hardship or recession however its important to note that this is not necessarily always true just like with any other type of business the demand for prostitution can fluctuate based on a variety of factors including economic conditions cultural attitudes and laws and policies for example during a recession people may have less disposable income and may be less likely to spend money on nonessential goods and services including prostitution on the other hand some people may turn to prostitution as a way to make money during difficult economic times its also important to note that prostitution can have negative consequences for the people involved including physical and emotional harm exploitation and stigma many countries and jurisdictions have laws that criminalize or regulate prostitution and there is ongoing debate about the best way to address the issue,1

sure meta means about the thing itself so if someone says thats so meta they might mean that the thing theyre talking about is a topic or idea thats related to itself or that its selfreferential in some way for example if someone is talking about a movie about making a movie that might be described as metannalpha can have a few different meanings depending on the context in general it means first or leading so if someone says thats so alpha they might mean that the thing theyre talking about is the first or most important of its kind for example if someone is talking about the first version of a software program they might describe it as the alpha versionnni hope that helps let me know if you have any other questions,1
there are a few different reasons why a company might choose to buy out another company for more than they will make back one reason is that the company being bought out may have valuable assets or intellectual property that the buying company wants to acquire for example yahoo might have wanted to buy tumblr because tumblr had a large user base and a popular platform for blogging and social networking similarly microsoft might have wanted to buy minecraft because it is a very popular and successful video game with a large and dedicated player base another reason a company might choose to buy out another company is to expand its reach or capabilities by acquiring another company the buying company can gain access to new markets customers or technologies that it didnt have before this can help the buying company grow and become more competitive in its industry finally a company might choose to buy out another company simply because it believes that the company is undervalued and has the potential to become much more valuable in the future in this case the buying company is willing to pay more upfront in order to potentially reap larger rewards down the line overall there are many different factors that can influence a companys decision to buy out another company and the specific reasons will vary depending on the specific situation,1
yes it is possible for certain sensory input to overload the brain and cause it to crash but this is not a common occurrence when we experience a lot of sensory input at once our brains have to work hard to process it all this can be tiring but it is not typically harmful however in rare cases some people may be more sensitive to certain types of sensory input and they may have a harder time processing it this can lead to feelings of confusion or disorientation and it may be difficult for them to think or function normally but this is not the same as the brain crashing and it is usually temporary,1

what does negative total equity means in mcdonalds balance sheet it means that their liabilities exceed their total assets  usually is means that a company has accumulated losses over time but thats just one explanation   but isnt mcdonald a very healthy company and never lost money just because a company has always money does not mean its a healthy company  it may have borrowed a lot of money in order to operate and now the growth is not able to keep up with the debt load in mcdonalds case the major driver in the equity change is the fact that they have bought back over 20 billion in stock over the past few years which reduces assets and equity  if they had instead paid off debt their equity would not be negative but their debt may be so cheap in terms of interest rate that it made more financial sense to buy back stock instead of paying off debt  there are too many variables to assess that in this forum,0
for mass production  it s usually not  for a small  plastic object  mass production would be done using something like injection molding  they make a metal mold  then inject molten plastic into it  depending on the size and complexity  you can put out 200 parts per hour  while a 3d printer may be able to do 1 or 2  with injection molding  the biggest cost is making the mold and setting up the machine  but you only pay that once  so it s the same whether you re making 10 parts or 100000  3d printing will probably be cheaper if you only need to make 10  but injection molding will definitely be more cost effective for 100000  3d printing also allows for the production of parts in a single step that would require multiple steps with traditional methods  for example  making hollow parts with injection molding requires making multiple pieces and joining them together  the premise is false  3d printing is not always  or even usually cheaper  it depends greatly on what you re making  and how much you re making of it  3d printing can be cheaper on low  volume products  but most certainly is not for high volume products  where a production line could make thousands of items in the same time it took to 3d print one  3d printing a single miniature for a game  or a spare part for a machine  might be cheaper for you  if you only want to make one single miniature  however  for a company that produces thousands of the same item  traditional manufacturing methods are way cheaper and faster  some car manufacturers use 3d printing for certain parts in prototype and concept models  because those cars only exist in a small number  once they ramp up the production of a car model  creating the parts though traditional methods quickly becomes cheaper  of course  that does nt mean it will stay this way forever  it s possible that some 3d printing technologies in the future will be so good that making the majority of goods that way will be cheaper  volume  if you want to make money by producing something  you usually need to set up a production line  that s expensive  if you want to make your money back  you either need to sell a  lot  or charge a lot  usually both   with a 3d printer  you have relatively cheap setup  a few thousand dollars compared to tens or even hundreds of thousands  with which you can go ahead and produce a  single  item  because your production setup is not limited to one unique item ,0
the first party is you  the second party is the person you are dealing with  the third party is someone who is nt originally involved in the deal  people generally do nt talk about the second party  instead talking about two first parties  also  if you re talking about literary perspective  the second person perspective is the narrator telling you what  you  are doing  for example   you walk to the refrigerator  you open the door and take out the milk  you drink the milk   the classic example is the  choose your own adventure novels    url0  you and i enter into a contract  i m going to teach you karate lessons for 6 months  and you are going to pay me 50 dollars a month  you are the first party  i am the second party  3 months down the road  your checks have all bounced and you are nt willing to pay me in something like cash  money order  cashiers check  so  i sell the debt you owe me to another person  i tell this person   give me 50 bucks  and you can collect on this 150 that my karate student owes me   this collector is the  third party   basically  the second party is whoever you entered into an agreement with  in the instance i gave you  when you are talking about the contract  you are the first party and i m the second  when i m talking about the contract  i m the first and you are the second  in order to minimize confusion  lots of contracts define who is first and who is second  sorry  i did nt really explain myself properly  lets use an iphone and an iphone case as an example  so i have an iphone and i want a case  if i buy a case made by apple  who also makes the iphone  i am buying a   firsty party   case  however if i buy a case  made by anyone other than apple  i am buying a   third party   case  where does the second party fit into this picture ,0
its possible that you are experiencing drowsiness because you are not getting enough sleep at night or because you are not engaging in physical activity during the day it could also be due to certain medications you are taking or because you are experiencing stress or other health issues if you are consistently feeling drowsy during meetings it might be a good idea to speak with a doctor or a healthcare professional to determine the cause and find ways to address it in the meantime you can try drinking a glass of water or taking a short walk to help stay awake and alert during meetings,1
it would take an unusual situation   they exercise certain types of option which come in as regular income rather than capital gains and are holding the stock long perhaps they are not allowed to sell because of an insidertrading freeze window like right before earnings announcements  and then the stock tanks  their company is acquired   they get stock options in their unicorn at 1share which blows up to 1000share right as hugefirm buys it options are swapped dollarfordollar for hugefirm stock at 250share so 4 shares for 1   i heard this happened a lot in the 19992000 boombust   and the problem was this type of stockoption had historically only been offered to 20million salary ceos and cfos who retained professional legal and financial counsel and knew how to deal with the pitfalls and traps of this type of option  during the dotcom boom it was also offered to rankandfile 50k salary tech employees who didnt even know the difference between a 401k and a roth   and it exploded in their faces making a big mess for everyone including the irs  now struggling to justify to congressmen why they were collecting 400000 in taxes on entirely phantom neverrealized income from a 24 year old tech guy earning 29k at a startup and eating ramen  when that poor guy never had a chance of understanding the financial rocks and shoals and even if he did couldnt have done anything about it since he wasnt a high executive involved in the decisions  and even the company who gave him the package didnt intend to inflict this on him  it was a mistake  even the irs dislikes nowin situations   some laws got changed some practices got changed etc etc and the problem isnt what it used to be,0
easier for machines to fill them that way instead of having to add another step of mixing  and the fruit probably settles during packaging and transport anyways    fruit  tends to be some sort of preserve so it will last longer while the yogurt is much more perishable and requires more specialized delivery systems  hence it s cheaper to have just one yogurt delivery system  otherwise  you d have to have several for different mixes or only do certain flavors each day between cleaning for a different flavor   the amount of fruit needed is so much smaller than yogurt it s much easier to swap out the fruit  because some flavors are more popular than others  so it s much easier to change the fruit than having giant tanks of pre  mixed   these days it s more accurate to call it  fruit  separate  as many have the mix on the side  i prefer these as i can control how sweet  fruity the yogurt ends up  things tend to be way too sweet for me for most foods in america to begin with  pre  mixed is readily available  usually next to the fruit  separate variety  usually cheaper  which suggests the better quality suppliers attempt to keep costs down by not pre  mixing and the issues it causes  i like to eat the yoghurt plain and save the fruit for  dessert   for most people however  i think the intent of fruit on the bottom is to mimic plain yoghurt with a fruit topping with a glob of yoghurt and fruit in each bite instead of a completely homogenized together flavored yoghurt ,0
ntour de france is a long and grueling bike race that takes place in france every year its one of the most famous and prestigious cycling events in the worldnnthere are teams in the tour de france because its easier for riders to work together and help each other out when they are on the same team riders on a team will often work together to protect their team leader who is the rider that has the best chance of winning the racennduring the race riders often ride in a big group called the peloton the peloton is made up of all the riders in the race and its usually the safest place to be because there is less wind resistance which makes it easier to ridennteams and riders determine when to make their move based on a variety of factors including the terrain the weather and the strength and tactics of the other teams some teams and riders might try to break away from the peloton and ride ahead of the pack in order to try to win the race other teams and riders might try to protect their team leader and keep them near the front of the pack so that they are in a good position to attack later in the racenntour de france is a complex and exciting race with many strategies and tactics at play its definitely a thrilling event to watch,1

grocery carts tend to turn left because of the way they are designed the front wheels of a grocery cart are usually mounted on a pivot which allows them to turn the pivot is typically located on the right side of the cart and this causes the cart to turn to the left when it is pushed forwardrnrnanother reason that grocery carts turn left is because of the way that people tend to push them most people are righthanded and they naturally push the cart with more force on the right side than on the left side this causes the cart to turn to the leftrnrnoverall the reason that grocery carts turn left is a combination of their design and the way that they are pushed it is not necessarily a design flaw but rather a result of the way that the carts are meant to function,1
a dead person with their eyes wide open can look pretty creepy and disturbing  closing the eyes gives a more peaceful look  however  the eyelids need to be sewed shut or had coins placed on them in the olden days to keep the lids closed  it s a custom made popular as a movie shortcut  when you see the star of the movie close the eyes of someone  you know the person is dead and wo nt be in the next scene  medical people i have worked with do nt generally do it  those that have say that it makes the person look like he is sleeping rather than staring lifeless  cause staring into a dead persons eyes is relatively creepy  no  really  it s unnerving  they stare off into space all dead  like  people who are having certain types of seizures   grand mal   although i think they changed the name  and a few other disorders have that same stare  it s not quite like the  thousand yard stare  that looks all dreamy  their eyes are just  dead ,0
a stock is just a thing  if you want to buy it and i want to sell it to you we do nt need a special market to do that  the stock market just makes it easier for you or i to find people who want to buy and sell  means just what you said  trades being done after the market has closed for the day  the market never really closes though  most companies only trade during hours because it has benefits and it s easier  more trades are being done with less fluctuations in pricing and it s more traditional  aht is risky  less people trade  it costs more to trade for the average investor  and your less likely to get the price you want  just some examples  there is a lot more to it than that  the same way we could buy and sell produce between us after the grocery store is closed ,0

toothpaste with stripes usually contains different colors because it has more than one flavor or formula the different colors or flavors are kept separate in the tube by using a special type of packaging called a laminate tubenna laminate tube is made up of several layers of material that are fused together like a sandwich each layer can hold a different type of toothpaste when you squeeze the tube the toothpaste is forced out through a small hole at the end and the different layers of toothpaste are squeezed out in stripes because they are separate from each othernnso the different colors of striped toothpaste dont mix together because they are kept separate in the tube by the laminate packaging when you brush your teeth the different colors or flavors of toothpaste mix together in your mouth but they stay separate in the tube,1
these tiny white spots that you see darting around your vision are called floaters floaters are small cloudy or semitransparent specks that move around in your field of vision they are usually caused by small bits of debris that are floating in the fluid that fills the inside of your eye called the vitreousrnrnwhen you look at the sky you are looking at a very large and uniform surface this can make floaters more noticeable because there is nothing else in your field of vision to distract your attentionrnrnfloaters are common and usually not a cause for concern however if you suddenly see a lot of new floaters or if you see flashes of light along with floaters you should contact your eye doctor as these can be signs of a more serious problem with the retina the lightsensitive layer at the back of the eye,1
we have tiny blood vessels going all throughout our body  the veins and arteries are just the biggest ones from which the tiny ones branch out from  if you cut a vein  there would be a lot more bleeding  blood flows from large arteries to move long distances  like down your arms  or legs  up to your head  the arteries branch out to small arterioles along their way  the arterioles pass to capillaries  which are tiny  the walls of the capillary are single cell thick  and its not wide enough for two red blood cells to travel side by side  the capillaries are where the oxygen transfer happens so they have to interweave with just about all the tissue of the body  those connect to venules and to the veins that return blood to the heart  so basically any cut you get will sever at least a whole bunch of capillaries  if not arterioles and venules  veins are overkill just to start bleeding  because every part of your body is filled with microscopic capillaries which provide every cell with oxygen and nutrients,0
people decipher ancient writing systems by looking for patterns in the way the symbols are used and by comparing the writing system to others that are already understood for example the sumerian number system used symbols to represent numbers just like we do today by comparing the symbols to other known systems and by looking for patterns in how they were used people were able to understand what the symbols meant and how to use them its a bit like solving a puzzle,1
soda tastes better cold because cold temperatures can help to dull the sensation of sweetness which can be overwhelming in soda the carbonation in soda can also be more refreshing when it is cold on the other hand coffee tastes better hot because heat helps to bring out the flavors and aromas of the coffee beans additionally the warmth of a hot cup of coffee can be comforting and enjoyable to drink it is possible that someone who has never drunk soda or coffee before might have a different preference for the temperature of these drinks however it is likely that most people would find that soda tastes better cold and coffee tastes better hot because these are the temperatures at which the flavors of these drinks are most pronounced ultimately whether a drink tastes better cold or hot is a matter of personal preference and peoples preferences can be influenced by a variety of factors including cultural and personal experiences,1
in quantum physics it is a fundamental principle that observing a system can affect its behavior this is known as the observer effectimagine you have a box with a ball inside it if you look inside the box to see where the ball is you are observing the ball but by simply looking at the ball you have changed its state before you looked the ball could have been anywhere in the box but once you observe it you have limited its possible locations to the spot where you see itin quantum physics this idea is taken to a much more extreme level it is not just the location of a particle that can be affected by observation but also other properties such as its energy and spin in fact the act of observing a quantum system can cause it to collapse from a superposition of multiple states into a single definite statethis might seem strange but it is a fundamental aspect of how the world works at the quantum level it is one of the things that makes quantum physics so different from classical physics which describes the behavior of large everyday objects like balls and boxes,1

the fbi s main duty is to investigate crimes  while the us marshalls  duty is to apprehend people  the fbi can arrest too  but that s not their main duty  the us marshalls does things like track down fugitives  serve warrants  etc  the fbi  hence  federal bureau of  investigation   is to investigate federal crimes  edit  spelling because in the federal system of checks and balances  it s important to make sure no one branch has all the guns and makes all the decisions as to who gets arrested the us marshalls are the enforcement division of the federal courts judicial branch they are the  beat cops  of the federal system  their bosses are judges who serve lifetime appointments the fbi is the criminal investigative body of the department of justice  executive branch   they are the detectives of the federal system  their boss is the attorney general who serves at the president s will and is confirmed by congress  we re more used to seeing our state justice system  in that system the check on power is typically between governments  state  county  city   since the federal government is the only national government  they divide responsibilities differently than local governments do    edit    the marshalls are apparently part of the doj  this makes more sense from a budgetary standpoint  but pretty well undermines the checks  and  balances explanation  essentially the eli5 answer should be  because the difference between a hypothetical  us marshalls  investigation division  and the  federal bureau of investigation  is pretty minute  when the fbi messes up  the fbi director gets fired  if they were part of the us marshalls  the head of that organziation would be fired  which would hurt the main part of the us marshalls service even though they did nt screw up  please  these types of questions are much more appropriate for r  answers ,0
requiring a payment at the time of application prevents people from spamming universities with applications without any intent of going to school there  the more expensive the school  the higher the application fee generally  i believe the general mindset is that if you ca nt afford the fee  you ca nt afford to attend the school  be prepared to be overcharged for everything at college  it s so they do nt have to go through a billion applications  only serious people will pay the fee to apply  limiting how many applications they will get  there are a few reasons   it limits the amount of applicants  if it was free they would get tons more  at a cost they get less  this helps them logistically cut down on how many apps they need to view and increase the chance a person applying really wants to attend the school  the cost of processing the app  its not free  they just pass it on to the applicant  you re the one wanting to go there  if you want to come  pay for our time   if you ca nt afford the fee  you probably ca nt afford to go here  so its a good way to cut out applicants who are not feasible ,0
a garbled circuit is a method for securely computing a function on two or more inputs in a way that preserves the privacy of the inputs it is a technique for secure multiparty computation which is the process of allowing two or more parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs privatennnnin a garbled circuit each input is first encrypted using a randomly generated key the encrypted inputs or garbled inputs are then passed through a series of gates which are essentially simple boolean functions that take one or more inputs and produce an output based on those inputs the gates are constructed in such a way that the output of the function can be computed without revealing the inputs to any of the parties involvednnnnfor example suppose alice and bob want to compute the and function on two inputs but they do not want to reveal their inputs to each other using a garbled circuit alice and bob can each encrypt their inputs and pass the encrypted inputs through the and gate the output of the and gate will be the result of the and function on the two inputs but neither alice nor bob will be able to see the inputs or the outputnnnngarbled circuits have several important applications including secure multiparty computation secure voting systems and privacypreserving data analysis they are also a key component of many cryptographic protocols including secure computation protocols and zeroknowledge proofs,1
in most cases  supply and demand  no one decides what the dollar  euro ratio is  it is much better understood as an auction where at 15  there is a roughly the same number of people buying as selling euros  in some other cases  for example the hong kong dollar  the ratio is determined by the hong kong government  this is a somewhat complicated question  but in short  each country has a net amount of crap that its citizens and government own  your money is a coupon to be able to buy some of that crap  each country decides how many coupons they have  and the value of their currency is equal to the amount of crap they have divided by the amount of coupons that they ve printed  there is some regulation  but in general the prices are set by people that buy and sell lots of crap and exchange currency to do so  if one country s coupons can buy twice as much crap as another s  that country can sell that coupon for two of the other country s coupons  but not three  because nobody would buy them at that price  so the value of the currency tends to balance on what it s actually worth in crap  there is a global currency exchange market  at that market  people can basically making a post saying  hey  i would like to buy this many dollars at this price in euros   if someone else has already said  hey i would like to sell this many dollars at the same price   then they get together and can make the transaction and both posts disappear  if there is nobody out there to take your offer to buy or sell  then that offer just stays up there and anyone can choose to take you up on it  the market price is the line between between the open buying and selling offers that nobody has taken  there will always actually be a very small range between the lowest selling price and the highest buying price ,0
in order to be minted as valid currency  they must have a value assigned to them  since the value of gold fluctuates  it makes no sense to print actual value  instead  the mints choose smaller denominations  knowing that no sane person would actually spend the coin as currency at that value  it s a commemorative coin not actual currencyalthough i think it can legally be considered valid us currency   they are collectors items  sold way above the value of the metals to make profit for the mint  in the royal canadian mint  the person who designs the coin gets to choose the value attached to it  i expect us practice is similar ,0
pi ï€ is not equal to 180 degrees pi is a mathematical constant that represents the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter it is a fundamental concept in mathematics and it appears in many different areas of science and engineering the number pi is approximately 314 but it is an irrational number which means that it has an infinite number of decimal places and cant be expressed as a simple fraction in geometry we use pi to describe the properties of circles for example the circumference of a circle is the distance around the circle and it is equal to 2ï€ times the radius of the circle where the radius is the distance from the center of the circle to the edge the degree is a unit of measurement for angles one full circle is 360 degrees and half of a circle is 180 degrees so to answer your question pi is not equal to 180 degrees because it is a mathematical constant that describes the properties of circles while degrees are a unit of measurement for angles,1

because at every level  the incentives were all in favor of people making decisions contrary to the public good  it was a logistical structure built around the premise that people would simply obey their masters because their masters worked for the  public good   on the one hand  working harder and innovating did nt yield any rewards  on the other hand  cheating the system  did   so all up and down the system  you had people who were either withholding the full measure of their capabilities or turning those capabilities to graft  in contrast  an american farmer works harder because he makes more money  he does nt under  report his production because it would nt make any sense to do so  he wo nt get paid for anything he does nt report  similarly  the people transporting  distributing and retailing the food are all primarily interested in getting the most they can to the customer so they can get paid  the soviet workers had a saying   as long as they pretend to pay us  we ll pretend to work   the function of a nation s economy is to deliver the goods to the people  farmland only does a nation good if it gets farmed and the food gets to the people  a good economy gets the farmers what they need to farm and gets the food they grow to the people  that s the difference between an empty field and sam s club  communism failed as an economic system because it motivated people to cheat rather than work  you got the same whether you contributed or not  so the only way to make more was to cheat  the farmer was nt getting the goods he needed to farm because the one is charge of that was cheating him  and whatever he did get he had no motive to farm with it because he would earn the same anyway  that gave him no reason to work but a good reason to cheat someone else  so the field lay fallow and some other guy did nt get his food  multiply that over a nation and nothing got distributed to anyone ,0

heat is the movement of particles in a star the particles are atoms when you squeeze something you are putting pressure on it this pressure can cause the atoms to move around more and bump into each other more often when atoms bump into each other they can transfer energy to each other this transfer of energy can make the atoms move around even more which we experience as heatnnin a star the pressure is so strong that it can cause the atoms to move around so much that they start to fuse together this process is called nuclear fusion and it releases a huge amount of energy in the form of heat and light the heat and light produced by nuclear fusion is what makes a star shinennso to summarize when you squeeze something the particles inside it start to move around more and bump into each other this movement and bumping can create heat in a star the pressure is so strong that it can cause atoms to fuse together which releases a lot of heat and light,1

jup  if you try to google it  there is a lot of stuff on the internet dealing with lucid dreaming and how it can be trained  i will give you a quick sum up  so  lucid dreaming means the state in a dream where you know you are in a dream  usually this results in you waking up  but sometimes and for some people they stay in the dream state  staying in the dream gives you the ability to influence the outcome  for example  i often had the same dreams over and over as a child  often involving dinosaurs  at some point i realised it is a dream  and that i can do what i want  so if something happened i knew it would  and i could alter the course of the dream to my wish  crazy stuff happened  in puberty the dinosaurs mostly changed to naked women but at some point i just went back to regulã¤r dreams  now how do you train it  i am far from an expert here  but as far as i know you should start with writing a dream diary  immediatly after you wake up focus on the dream  writing it down or speaking it into a recording device  do this every night and you will start to remember your dreams more vividly  it takes time  but if you look into what you write down you can often find certain patterns  helping you to understand how your own dreams work  focus before falling asleep  get the idea into your head that all that s comming is a dream and you want to remember it  it takes time  but it can certainly enhance your own personal sleeping quality  also nothing could happen  it depends on the person  yep  check out the side bar at r  luciddreaming try listening to binural beats  there s alot of great stuff out there  i ve found that i lucid dream on the nights i fall asleep with head phones on ,0

when some evangelicals speak in tongues they believe that they are speaking in a language that is not known to them but is given to them by the holy spirit this is often accompanied by physical movements such as shaking or crying some people believe that speaking in tongues is a way for them to communicate with god or to express their deep emotions and spiritual connection it is not uncommon for people who speak in tongues to feel a sense of peace joy and closeness to god nits important to note that not all evangelicals believe in speaking in tongues and there are many different interpretations of this practice within the christian community some people see it as a way to connect with god while others may view it as a form of religious expression that is not necessarily connected to any particular belief or doctrine ultimately the experience of speaking in tongues is different for everyone and it is something that is highly personal and unique to each individual,1
it s called triage  not a crazy system  but a long time medical practice  fix the most broken people first  treat the worst injuries  time sensitive threats first  ie you have a broken wrist  the other guy is having chest pains  and someone shows up with the sniffles  your wrist is nt getting any broker  but swift intervention may stop a heart attack  assess for heart issues  chest pains turn out to be a gas bubble  place on ignore  now we look at the wrist  gas bubble waits  whoops  gunshot victim shows up  wrist waits for a while while gunshot person is stabilized and sent to surgery  sniffles over there watches another rerun of sportscenter  and we go back to that pesky wrist  gas bubble falls asleep  but then farts it all out so he s woken up and discharged  sniffles complains  but then again  who cares  back to the wrist  call someone in to x  ray and cast it  but then a motorcycle rider shows up  on a stretcher  tox screen and radiology  holds up the wrist x  ray for a while  sniffles is now on his ipad signing up for a fantasy football league  you get fed up  grab a scalpel and cut your other wrist  up and down  like a pro  start bleeding on the floor  now you re a priority  assuming you re talking about walking in  rather than arriving by ambulance  they take you to talk to a nurse who reviews the basics of your case  assuming there was no immediately obvious medical emergency  like bleeding all over the place   that nurse then decides how pressing your treatment is  for example  a broken bone or possible fall injury generally do nt require immediate treatment  beyond making sure the person do nt move affected areas  arm  back  etc   they can just fit you in to the x  ray machines and such as there is time  however  if you were there for something like suspected internal bleeding  stroke  etc the time that they spent waiting could have a serious impact on your chances of survival and recovery  so they could prioritize having the doctors see you over someone with a broken arm  the emergency room has guidelines like these for a wide range of cases  and it generally comes down to who is likely to die or be seriously maimed for life first  which is also why people who arrive by ambulance generally get to skip the line waiting for a room  if you could nt even get there under your own power  it s much more likely you need immediate treatment  i just want everyone to know  op once viewed his own sperm under a microscope ,0
one of the rare moments i get to use my theology degree  this is a commonly misunderstood concept  the devil is not the  ruler  or jailer of hell  there is no scripture to support this  he s as much a prisoner and suffers just as much as any other soul in hell  you re getting into later eras of christianity for that   the devil  in the bible is basically two separate figures who got conflated later on  i want to say by dante  but i m not certain  it s been a while since i studied that  anyway  there s lucifer and ha  satan  lucifer is the light bringer  the leader of the choirs who decided he could raise himself above god and was cast down for it  basically a classical promethean figure  then there s ha  satan  the main source of ideas of who  the devil  is  i think  he worked like god s prosecuting attorney  he s most prominent in job in which he presses god to prove job loves him unconditionally  and not just because he s been prosperous  he s a neutral figure in charge of testing people  it was much later on in christianity that these two were melded together a bit and it became kind of non  canon fanfiction that treated them both as  the devil  and mixed their stories together  if you were to ask me  this question is flawed  i no longer believe in the bible  but as a strong ex  christian  i can say that hell  from my point of view  was never something in the realm of reality  i was raised a jehovah s witness  we did nt believe in hell  but we were christian  that is because there is no scripture supporting its evidence  at least not directly  there are references to hades and sheol  these have been translated to hell in most bibles  but it is understood that hades and sheol were terms used to describe the state of the dead  not a spiritual place you go to after death  also  ecclesiastes 95 states the dead are conscious of nothing  therefore the existence of hell or even going to heaven after you die is contradictory ,0

it would dry out pretty quickly and at some point just fall off  it s not a mainstream belief  but some people believe that s actually a healthier way to treat the umbilical cord because cutting it right away separates the baby form the placenta  isolating it from a nutrient source  the science on this belief is somewhat sketchy however and is mostly regarded as dubious  pseudoscientific  first of all  it s important to note that the umbilical cord does not connect a baby to the mother  it connects a baby to the placenta  the placenta is attached to the uterine wall during pregnancy  but is expelled during childbirth  often called the  afterbirth    the placenta and cord eventually dry up and fall off if the cord is nt cut  it dries out and falls off  humans are the only animals who cut it  every other animal just lets it dry out ,0

these systems are so useful  that many governments do nt want to be restricted to something that is controlled by a foreign government  for example  gps is a military system run by the us navy  they could  if they wanted to  shut it off or degrade it  the russians were nt happy with relying on a us military system  given that there is a lot of disagreement between russia and america  so they built their own  glonass   in europe  the eu government were concerned that they were relying on a foreign military system for a lot of commercial and government work  they were also annoyed that gps only made a crude signal available for the public and law enforcement  but the military got a much higher precision signal  so  the eu government decided to build their own system  galileo  which would give an improved accuracy free public signal  and a premium signal  with paid subscription  which would give the same accuracy as the gps military signal  it would also be optimized for use in europe  gps satellites do nt really orbit over the arctic region  so gps reception in places like north norway or northern sweden is not very reliable  the galileo satellites are intended to go into orbits which go much further north  but the disadvantage is that you need more satellites to cover the increased amount of land  same sort of thing with irnss  india  and beidou  china   in general  all these systems you broadly the same technology but on slightly different frequencies  this means your receiver needs to have an antenna and circuits capable of receiving all the different systems  dual system gps  glonass receivers have been available for a while  they were nt terribly popular initially because the glonass system has been very unreliable with satellites dying or malfunctioning and not being replaced  however  the russians have repaired and updated their glonass satellites  and it s now a good quality modern system  so most latest generation gps receivers do actually receive the glonass signal as well  one of the advantages of a receiver which supports both systems is that it is possible to get a more accurate position because you can combine the measurements from both systems when the receiver does the final position calculation  the galileo system is nt complete  in fact  it is nt really functional  as it does nt have enough satellites to work 247  however  many new gps receivers are  galileo ready  which means that they have the antenna and circuits in place  but the firmware to process the signals has nt been finalized  once enough satellites are up and working  the manufacturer of the receiver will be able to test their firmware  and then once tested and working will be make it available for download  they re really just different systems used by different regions  gps is american  glonass is russian  and galileo is european  all 3 have 2 sides to them  they have the public side that you and i can use to get around and they have the private side that governments use for all of their various needs like reconnaissance  spying and weapon guidance  it s not like we would give the russians access to our private side so they needed to make a private side of their own  then europe needed one  india believed they needed one as well so here we are  at first  there was only gps  which is american  run and american  controlled  that means that there was the possibility of america shutting off access to other countries  russia and the eu did nt want to take that risk and so they developed glonass and galileo  respectively  now india is doing the same thing with irnss ,0
the global population is the total number of people on earth it tends to increase every day because more people are being born than are dying however there are natural disasters and manmade disasters that can affect the population for example if a disease spreads and many people get sick and die or if there is a war and many people are killed the population may decreasennthere is a debate about whether the earths population will eventually become too large a phenomenon known as overpopulation some people believe that the earth has limited resources such as food and water and that if the population grows too large there may not be enough of these resources to go around others believe that humans are resourceful and will find ways to use technology and innovation to meet the needs of a growing populationnnit is difficult to predict exactly when overpopulation might become an issue as it depends on many factors such as the rate of population growth advances in technology and resource management and the impact of disasters some experts believe that the earths population may eventually stabilize at a certain level while others believe that it will continue to grow indefinitely,1
how so if i sell short then i make a profit only if the price goes down so i can buy back at a lower price yes but if the price is going up then you would go long instead shorting a stock or any other asset allows you to profit when the price is going down going long allows you to profit when the price is going up in the opposite cases you lose money in order to make a profit in either of those situations you have to accurately assess which way the price will trade over the period of time you are dealing with if you make the wrong judgment then you lose money because youll either sell for a lower price than you bought if you went long or have to buy back at a higher price than you sold for if you went short in either case unless the trader can live with making a shortterm loss and recouperating it later one needs a good stoploss strategy,0
punching through solid objects like wood or brick is not something that can be done by most people and it is not a common or practical technique in martial arts in fact attempting to punch through hard surfaces can cause serious injury to the hand and wrist as well as damage the object being punched nhowever some people may demonstrate the ability to break certain objects such as wood or brick using techniques that involve striking the object with a focused precise force this is typically done using a combination of physical strength speed and technique as well as proper conditioning of the hand and wrist to withstand the impact nthe scientific explanation for this phenomenon is that the force of the punch is concentrated on a small area allowing the punch to break the object in addition the object being punched may have imperfections or weaknesses that allow it to break more easily when struck nits important to note that breaking objects is not a common or necessary skill in martial arts and attempting to do so can be dangerous its always important to train safely and use proper protective equipment to prevent injury,1
its a question of the amount of nuclear material that was left behind  hiroshima  nagasaki had a brief but large blast of radiation that  while significant  dissipated over time  the blasts were in air so the amount of radioactive material left over was relatively minimized  and mostly burned out after the blast  a blast on the ground would have been significantly worse  as chernobyl was   source   url2   source 2   url1   source 3   url0  chernobyl has radioactive material that is  still on site today  and is  actively producing radiation   this is a  huge  difference  whereas the radioactive material of hiroshima and nagasaki was relatively minimal post  blast  chernobyl s radioactive material remains on site  there is a similar problem with fukushima  insofar as the melted  damaged rods in reactor 1  3 are still there  and containment of that material is very  very difficult  chernobyl in the aftermath did have some level of containment built in  but considering that it was the first disaster of its kind  magnitude edit  the quality and longevity of the structure built was  well it was nt built to last  there are now efforts for a more permanent sarcophagus to be placed over chernobyl to permanently and securely contain the radiation   the wwii bombs had less than 100 kg of nuclear fuel  chernobyl likely had several tons on site  the wwii bombs processed the nuclear fuel a lot less efficiently than a modern nuclear reactor  resulting in less fallout produced per kilogram  the wwii bombs were detonated in the air  half of the fallout when up into the stratosphere  and much of the rest was blown or washed out to sea  most of the fallout in chernobyl was contained within the area  after 70 years  most of the fallout in japan would have decay away to safe levels  the same is true for chernobyl after 30 years  far from a wasteland  people could live there  albeit with increase cancer risks  after 40 more years  it will be safer still because the public fear of nuclear weapon fallout is greatly exagerated  do nt get me wrong  its really bad  but nuclear weapons do nt produce perpetual nuclear wastelands unless many detonations occur at very low altitudes ,0

suppliers to produce computers which could all run the same software  this wave of computing required an operating system which was relatively easy to configure and use  since these were going to run independently on the desktops of the secretaries and salesmen  microsoft had software which fit the bill and was accessible to business types  as pcs took off  software developers did nt want to manage many different versions of their code  so they eventually settled on windows  this creates a feedback loop where you want to run the latest software which is only on windows and then people want to make new software and all of the customers are running windows  if we should remember microsoft for anything is that they were a company which created standards during a time of diversity and even not  so  great standards are often better than dozens of different ways to do something  bill gates was a pioneer at making for commercial sale software for personal computers  before personal computers software was either written once by a big company for use on a small number of computers they owned or leased to other big companies  or was written once for use by a company on their big computers that they shared with nobody else   you can substitute  big government agency  for  big company  in the above example   these computers  and the software that ran on them was priced as something only really large organizations could afford to pay  the very idea of a  personal computer  was completely outside this ecosystem  the idea that an average homeowner could buy a computer was revolutionary  the business model that existed for big companies to use big computers would nt work for a business where individuals bought computers and software  personal computers required a business model where the cost to make the software could be recouped by selling that software to many  many buyers at a  comparatively  low price  gates succeeded in figuring out how to make software for personal computers at a cost that allowed him to sell that software at a price people who bought personal computers could afford to pay  he also created a development model for figuring out how to do that repeatably  the combination put microsoft into a small group of leading companies ready to make a lot of money as personal computers turned from an extreme curiosity to a commonplace household appliance  but he was nt done  due to a series of strange events  gates ended up providing the operating system for the first ibm pc  and in an even stranger series of events  he ended up with the rights to sell that operating system to other companies  this proved to be a one  two punch  first the ibm pc sold in huge numbers  so providing the operating system created a river of cash to microsoft  but gates also got lucky  in that the operating system he was selling to ibm was something that other companies wanted to buy because they figured out how to  clone  the ibm pc  he ended up making a second river of cash from the companies competing with ibm  and ibm could nt stop him  having a single unified standard operating system for pcs made it possible for a lot of companies to compete in that market  and the explosion of competition drove prices down and evolved features at a pace no other market in human history has ever experienced  the number of personal computers sold  and thus computers microsoft was earning money from  exploded  microsoft was smart to price its operating system low enough so that there was not much interest in  cloning  the operating system   there were clones  but they mostly did nt get much attention   at that juncture  you could say gates did the following  figured out a profitable  sustainable business model for a personal computer software company figured out how to create new personal computer software in a profitable and sustainable way made good choices about partnering with ibm and made a superior deal with ibm that permitted microsoft to profit from  cloning  of the ibm pc when that happened gates of course had other talented and smart people around him during this time like steve ballmer and paul allen  so it is nt really fair to say that gates all by himself did these things  but the oral histories of the time suggest that gates was usually the driving force  had the right vision  and made the key decisions  so it s probably fair to say that he s  responsible   there were microsoft decisions  products  services that followed that moment that had huge effects on personal computers and personal computer software  but they happened after microsoft  got big  so it s harder to argue that gates  by himself  was the focus of the decisions that caused those effects  microsoft achieved a  computer in every home  goal  they allowed to mass product cheap easy to use pcs  as for consumers as well as for developers   his achievements as computer scientists are not great  he achieved more as a good businessman  he is a founder of one of the most important companies of today ,0
a ranked voting system is a way of casting and counting votes in an election where voters are able to rank the candidates in order of preference instead of just choosing one candidate voters can indicate their top choice second choice third choice and so onin a ranked voting system if a candidate wins a majority of firstchoice votes they are declared the winner just like in a normal election if no candidate wins a majority of firstchoice votes then the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated and their votes are redistributed to the voters next choice this process is repeated until one candidate has a majority of votes and is declared the winnerone advantage of ranked voting is that it can help ensure that the winner of an election has the support of a majority of voters rather than just a plurality of voters in a normal election it is possible for a candidate to win with less than 50 of the vote if there are more than two candidates running in a ranked voting system this is less likely to happen because the votes of the least popular candidate can be redistributed to the voters next choiceas for how a ranked voting system could help eliminate the twoparty system its important to note that ranked voting is just one of many potential reforms that could help encourage more political diversity however ranked voting could potentially help by making it easier for thirdparty candidates or independent candidates to win elections since voters are able to rank multiple candidates in order of preference they can choose to support a thirdparty candidate as their first choice while still expressing a preference for one of the major party candidates as their second choice this could make it more likely that a thirdparty candidate could win an election or at least have a stronger influence on the outcome,1

sunni and shia islam are the two largest branches of islam with the overwhelming majority of muslims being sunni the main difference between the two branches is that sunni muslims believe that the first four caliphs religious leaders after the death of the prophet muhammad were the rightful leaders of the muslim community while shia muslims believe that the first caliph ali was the rightful leadernnthis difference in belief has led to some tension between the two groups as each group feels that their interpretation of islam is the correct one in some parts of the world these differences have led to violence and conflict however it is important to note that the vast majority of muslims whether sunni or shia want peace and respect the beliefs of others,1

regardless of how i  or anyone else  views the holiday  kwanzaa is an african  american celebration that is primarily observed in the southern states  it first came about in america about sixty years ago  in the heat of the black rights movement  it was created as a way for black americans to celebrate the traditions true to their heritage while living in america  it was not made as a substitute for christmas  though some choose to have it be so  it was created as a non  religious african  american celebration  to recognize the traditions that were carried over from africa  kwanzaa is now usually celebrated along side christmas  and consists of home  made gifts  core values such as family and friends  and food  i celebrated kwanzaa for a period of 5  6 years with my family when i was a child  my experience was very positive  and i m glad i celebrated it  as it gave me an interest in learning more about the various cultures  countries in africa  many black americans celebrate kwanzaa  but the majority do not  it probably would nt be a good idea to give your black friends  coworkers  in  laws kwanzaa cards  unless you know for sure they celebrate it  kwanzaa for my family was a time where we could get together with other like  minded people  which often included non  black people who were interested in kwanzaa  who simply wished for alternatives during the holiday season  there was no santa claus  no church  no jesus  no people asking you to spend your hard  earned money on things you did nt need  we got together  ate good food  often learned something about west  east african cultures and history  and just had a good time being together  kwanzaa varies for the people who celebrate it  some see it as a political celebration  and there is a lot of posturing  while others enjoy the connection it brings with the community  my family celebrated kwanzaa because it allowed us to connect with our ancestors in west africa  even via blended  made  up traditions  the first year of kwanzaa  my family celebrated all seven days  and gave presents to each other each day  the presents could not be bought  that is  we had to give something of  ours  to other members of our family  it was a cool experience  we also went to local events in our  mixed  community  in the later years  we only went to local kwanzaa events and eventually stopped  u  hiterwasasexymofo is wrong about many things concerning kwanzaa  1  the reason why swahili  kiswahili was chosen as the language of kwanzaa is because it is the language of the pan  african movement that started in east africa  where swahili is a unifying language in the region   this is not exclusive to kwanzaa  as many black  power movements and figures used swahili in solidarity with those in  east  africa  2  kwanzaa does not further  racial divisiveness   kwanzaa began as a way to connect african americans with the  african  part of their heritage  a heritage that many black people unfortunately saw as inherently negative or less  than  further  non  black people are welcome in kwanzaa celebrations  and can celebrate it with their non  black families if they wish  3  kwanzaa was not invented  by a us prisoner  in the 60s  karenga was convicted of assault in the early 1970s  this was after the creation of kwanzaa  tldr  light some red  black  and green candles  shout  harambe   a couple of times  and chow down on kwanzaa cake  url0 one thing that is nt being mentioned here is the reason why anyone wanted such an observance  most people have cultural traditions that go back a long way  and its part of cultural heritage and identity  many black americans have lost that link to their ancestry  because some generations ago their ancestors were kidnapped into slavery  stuff like kwanzaa helps people like that to feel that they belong to part of a larger culture that has traditions and heritage ,0

in the early days of the internet when it was still a relatively small and specialized network each country was assigned a twoletter code called a toplevel domain tld to identify the country where a website was based this made it easy for people to know which websites were from which countries nfor example the tld for italy is it so websites with this tld are likely to be based in italy similarly the tld for brazil is br so websites with this tld are likely to be based in brazil nhowever as the internet has grown and become more widely used more and more people and organizations outside of these countries have wanted to use these tlds for their own websites to meet this demand the number of tlds has been expanded to include many more options beyond just the twoletter codes for countries nfor example in addition to the tlds for countries like it and br there are now also tlds for specific types of organizations such as edu for educational institutions gov for government agencies and com for commercial businesses there are also tlds for specific communities such as org for nonprofit organizations and net for internet service providers nas a result it is no longer necessary for websites in the united states to have a specific tld to identify their country of origin instead they can choose from a wide range of tlds that are more specific to their purpose or community,1
a construction loan is a shortterm loan used to finance the building or renovation of a home or other real estate project the loan is typically secured by the property being built or renovated and is disbursed in stages as the construction progressesconstruction loans can be used for new construction additions or renovations to an existing property or the acquisition and rehabilitation of a property they may be offered by banks credit unions or other financial institutions and are usually accompanied by a detailed construction schedule and a set of construction drawingsconstruction loans generally have higher interest rates than traditional mortgage loans and often require a higher down payment the lender will also typically require the borrower to have a certain amount of equity invested in the project as well as a strong credit score and financial historyduring the construction process the lender will typically make disbursements to the borrower in stages as certain milestones are reached the borrower will also be responsible for making regular interest payments on the loan once the construction is complete the borrower will typically refinance the construction loan into a permanent mortgage loan,1
the maya is a mesoamerican civilization  noted for the only known fully developed written language of the pre  columbian americas  as well as for its art  architecture  and mathematical and astronomical systems  initially established during the pre  classic period  c 2000 bc to ad 250   according to the mesoamerican chronology  many maya cities reached their highest state of development during the classic period  c ad 250 to 900   and continued throughout the post  classic period until the arrival of the spanish  the inca empire or inka empire was the largest empire in pre  columbian america  the administrative  political and military center of the empire was located in cusco in modern  day peru  the inca civilization arose from the highlands of peru sometime in the early 13th century  from the 13th century  the valley of mexico was the heart of aztec civilization  here the capital of the aztec triple alliance  the city of tenochtitlan  was built upon raised islets in lake texcoco  the triple alliance formed a tributary empire expanding its political hegemony far beyond the valley of mexico  conquering other city states throughout mesoamerica  tldr differences  different people  different places  mayans came before the others  incas lived in the andes mountains in south america mayans lived on the yucatan peninsula in mexico aztecs lived in central mexico it s like asking  what s the difference between the babylonians  the byzantines  and the nazis   there s a lot of differences  they re all totally different   edit   i m not implying that one of the mesoamerican tribes are like the nazis  it was just the first thing that came to mind    the mayans   are supposed to be really bloody  lots of human sacrifices  lots of war   but some people are now saying that if you really met them you would nt think so  they developed a written numbering system with a concept of zero  and they played spectator sports with big rubber balls in hoops  the winning team got to be sacrificed  they lived in southern mexico  and disappeared under mysterious circumstances    the incans   lived in the andes mountains in peru  they raised llammas  and had a numbering and currency system based on knots in rope  they worshiped the sun and were supposed to be peace loving  they were defeated by francisco pizzaro  a spanish conquistador who wanted their gold    the aztecs   lived after the mayans and had a capitol in what is now mexico city  they are the primary culture that modern mexicans look back on and identify with in their homeland  so you will see lots of aztec style art and textiles in modern mexico  even on their flag  they invented hot chocolate  they were kinda like a mesoamerican rome in that they conquered lots of other peoples but let them keep their own cultural autonomy  so they had a really big empire that they only sortof had control over  they were defeated by cortez who tried to beat them by hiring these other tribes to kill them  but ultimately won by exposing everyone to smallpox ,0
there are a few ways that investors can potentially make significant money on low volume stocksbuy and hold some investors believe that buying and holding a stock even if it has low trading volume can be a successful strategy if the companys fundamentals are strong and the stock is undervalued the stocks price may eventually rise as more investors become aware of ittrade on news if a low volume stock receives positive news coverage or there is some other positive development for the company this can lead to an increase in trading volume and potentially a corresponding increase in the stocks priceuse options options allow investors to speculate on the future price of a stock without actually owning the stock this can be a way for investors to make significant money on low volume stocks although it is also a higher risk strategy as the value of options is derived from the underlying stock and can be highly volatileit is important to note that investing in low volume stocks carries additional risks such as reduced liquidity and higher volatility and may not be suitable for all investors it is always important to thoroughly research a stock and carefully consider the risks before making an investment,1

in many cases  it was the result of the subjugation of a people by a much more powerful invading force  the soldiers of those people could nt stop them  and so the common laborers did nt stand much of a chance  other times  it was a result of contact with societies where slavery was already an accepted practice  people are much less likely to revolt against something that they were brought up to believe is normal  it s not like somebody just walks into town one day and says  you re all slaves  get used to it  and everyone just decides to agree to it  a group of people might get enslaved after they ve lost a major battle  with all the warriors gone  it s hard to rise up against somebody  sometimes  it s only a few people that get captured at a time  during capture  they ve probably had the shit beaten out of them which really reduces their will to try fighting again  other times  the slaves are kept split up so they ca nt organize a revolt  it s hard to start revolting when there s only 5 of you in one place  in the earliest days of american slavery  they tried to keep slaves from the same parts of africa separated  if the slaves ca nt talk to each other  it s harder for them to plan a revolt  even with all that  however   slave rebelions   url0  have taken place in pretty much every society that s had widespread slavery  they might not have been successful  but people will inevitably try   because they have control of horses and weapons that can kill a man in an instant from far away   and their vast wealth and technology has ensured that our leaders and neighbors leaders and our enemies leaders are now under their control   and they have railroads and massive ships that allow them to bring in fresh troops and weapons from far away   and 500 of their men  killed 12000 of our men in 5 days and they are still marching towards our main town ,0
theory teacher here  i ll try a very basic version    key   almost all music has a  home note   or a note that sounds like the end  if you can stop the song at some point  and it sounds like it could end there  chances are you found the home note  that s what key the song is in  normally in a song  you take a journey  so you start at home  then you take a trip to another home note  which is like checking into a hotel  you stay for a while  but you would nt want to live there  eventually you return to the home key  this is called  modulating   and some composers  songwriters are so good that you can barely tell where it changed  other times  they change right away  which is more noticeable    scale   in italian  scala means  stairs  which is where we get the word for scale  it s a sequence of steps  usually a pattern of whole steps or half steps  look up  intervals   the distance between notes  for more info   on the page  a scale looks like a big line going up or down  the most common scales have 7 notes before you reach the octave note  but there are others too  notably the pentatonic scale  5 notes   which is awesome because any note sounds good with any other note  lots of web games have been programmed with this in mind  or the simple one to improvise with is just play rhythms with any  all the black keys on the piano  try and find the home notes  there are two possibilities  one dark and one bright  the pentatonic scale is one of human kind s most ancient  it was discovered all over the world in vastly different places  even though the people could nt talk to each other because of the distances  bone flutes made by neanderthals have been found in germany and slovenia up to 100000 years ago that played pentatonic scales    modes   modes are just fancy scales  start playing a scale from any white key to any other white key to discover the new patterns of steps  they all have complicated sounding names  but the names are nt that important  just that each one has a particular  flavor   such as a lowered 2nd in the phyrigian which makes it sound dark and spanish   if the 3rd step is lowered  it s a minor mode and sounds dark  if it s raised it s a major mode and sounds bright  further alterations make them sound even brighter or darker and so you can organize them by  bright  to  dark  by changing only one note at a time  the   numbers are the difference from a major scale brightest   f  f  lydian 4   c  c  majorionian    g  g  mixolydian 7   d  d  dorian 3 7   a  a  aeolian 3 6 7   e  e  phrygian 2 3 6 7   b  b  locrian 2 3 5 6 7  darkest locrian mode is like the black sheep of the family  it s really hard to convince someone that the first note of locrian is your home  because there s a tri  tone interval  that s the 5  instead of a nice stable 5th for the home chord  happy to answer questions  edit  my archaeology needed checking every song is in a certain key  the key of a song can be worked out by knowing the notes of the song  but good musicians can tell what key a song is in just by listening  basically  the key of a song is a label  like  a    b  or  c  that musicians give to a song so they know how to play things over the top of it that sound good  once a musican knows the key of a song  he or she might want to play something  like a guitar solo  or a violin melody  over the top of it  a scale is just a list of notes that sound good over a piece of music  so if you know the key of a song  you pick a scale  and play only notes in that scale  scales are how musicians  improvise  over music  they are basically safe notes that will always sound quite good  but to play really well of course requires more than just knowing scales  you need a lot of practise and a good musical ear  different scales have different feels  some have a happy sound  like the major scale  and some have a sad sound  like the minor scale  which scale you pick depends on how you want the tune to sound  modes are really just special types of scales  and are used by more advanced musicans  there are seven modes  each of which has a different  feel  to it  the most simple mode is called the ionian  which is the major scale  the happy scale we talked about   then for example the phrygian mode sounds very spanish  think of the miserlou opening to pulp fiction  if you ever managed to watch it when your parents were out   some of the modes sound very strange and are only used by crazy musicians with weird hair and silly shoes  so the key is the label  the scale are the good notes that you can play if you know the key  and modes are really just special types of scales   great music dictionary online    url0  the terms you re asking about are often used interchangeably  there are however  specifics to consider  a scale is essentially a collection of notes in some kind of logical order  there are many possible scales  each with their own unique musical flavour   key   from dolmetsch  specific scales or series of notes defining a particular  tonality   for example  certain keys may  on the basis of the sequence of successive intervals  be defined as major or minor and are then named after their tonic or key note modes are almost like scales  in that they are more or less scales  but are treated in their own special context  if we are in the   key   of a major  we might play notes from the a major   scale    however  depending on the harmonic context  we may choose not to think  tonally   for instance  if we re playing a ii  v progression  ad infinitum  in a major  we re in  modal  harmonic territory  when improvising or writing in this context  it s likely you would use b dorian and e mixolydian   scales    these two scales have the exact same notes as an a major scale  they just start and end on notes other than the tonic  b and e respectively   because of this  they are referred to as   modes   of the a major scale  they share the same notes  but are applied in their own unique manner  it s also possible to hear a minor  major key referred to as a minor  major mode if the harmony is modal  modal music has chord progressions that are characteristic of a certain mode and does not have any  tonal  references  ie perfect cadences  tonicizations  etc   ,0
its possible for a seller to offer an item for sale on ebay for 3 without charging for shipping because the cost of shipping the item is included in the 3 price this means that the seller is willing to absorb the cost of shipping the item as part of the price of the itemrnrnsellers can do this for a number of reasons for example they may be trying to attract more buyers by offering a low price for the item they may also have low overhead costs such as if they are able to get discounted shipping rates or if they are able to ship items in bulk which can help them save money on shippingrnrnits also possible that the item being sold is small and lightweight which means that it would not cost much to ship in this case the seller could still make a profit even if they are only charging 3 for the item and offering free shippingrnrnfinally its important to remember that sellers on ebay are free to set their own prices and shipping policies so its possible that a seller may choose to offer an item for a low price and include the cost of shipping in that price even if it means that they are not making a large profit on the sale,1

captcha systems are designed to prevent spam by requiring users to prove that they are human this is usually done by showing the user an image with distorted text or a series of images with a specific pattern and asking them to enter the text or select the images that match the pattern nspammers might try to use automated programs to send out large numbers of spam messages but these programs would not be able to solve the captcha therefore captcha systems can effectively block spam because they can distinguish between human users and automated programs none reason that captcha systems are difficult to break is that they can be designed to be very difficult for a computer to interpret for example the text in the image might be distorted in a way that is easy for a human to read but hard for a computer to recognize similarly the pattern of images might be difficult for a computer to recognize without the context that a human would naturally bring to the task noverall captcha systems are an effective way to prevent spam because they require humans to prove that they are human which is something that automated programs cannot do,1
cricket is a sport played with a bat and a ball the goal is to score runs by hitting the ball and running between two sets of three sticks called wickets on opposite ends of a rectangular field one team the batting team tries to score as many runs as possible by hitting the ball and running back and forth between the wickets the other team the fielding team tries to get the batting teams players out and stop them from scoring runs there are two main types of cricket matches test matches and shorter matches test matches are longer and played over a period of five days shorter matches like one day internationals odis and twenty20 t20 matches are played in a single day or over a few days in a test match each team gets two chances to bat called innings the team that scores the most runs in their two innings wins the match in shorter matches each team only gets one innings to score as many runs as possible the team that scores the most runs wins the match there are several ways that a player can be out in cricket some common ways are caught if the fielding team catches the ball after the batsman hits it the batsman is out bowled if the ball hits the wicket while the batsman is trying to hit it the batsman is out leg before wicket lbw if the ball hits the batsmans leg and would have hit the wicket if the leg wasnt there the batsman is out run out if the fielding team hits the wicket with the ball while the batsman is running between the wickets the batsman is out there are many more rules and details in cricket but those are the basic ideas i hope that helps let me know if you have any more questions,1

sure the double slit experiment is a famous experiment in physics that helps us understand how light behavesnnimagine you have a wall with two tiny slits in it if you shine a flashlight at the wall the light will pass through the slits and create two beams of light on the other side of the wallnnnow imagine you put a screen on the other side of the wall to catch the light beams if you shine the flashlight at the wall and look at the screen you will see two bright spots where the light beams hit the screennnnow imagine you repeat this experiment but this time you cover one of the slits when you shine the flashlight at the wall and look at the screen you will only see one bright spotnnso far this is all pretty simple and makes sense but now lets do something strange imagine you cover both slits but this time you shine the flashlight at the wall very very slowly you might expect that you would see nothing on the screen because the light isnt passing through the slits but when you look at the screen you see something surprising instead of seeing nothing you see a pattern of light and dark bands on the screennnthis is the strange and mysterious part of the double slit experiment even when the light is not passing through the slits it still creates a pattern on the screen this tells us that light behaves in strange and unexpected ways and it is one of the reasons that physicists study light and try to understand how it works,1
fund managers of index trackers also known as passive fund managers aim to replicate the performance of a particular index such as the sp 500 or the ftse 100 as closely as possible to do this they typically invest in the same stocks as the index they are tracking in the same proportionsthe role of a passive fund manager is to ensure that the funds holdings are aligned with the index it is tracking and to make any necessary trades to maintain that alignment this may involve buying or selling stocks as the indexs composition changes such as when a company is added to or removed from the indexpassive fund managers do not try to outperform the market through stock picking or market timing instead they aim to match the performance of the index which means that the returns of the fund should be similar to the returns of the index this approach is often seen as a lowcost alternative to actively managed funds which try to outperform the market through the use of more complex investment strategies fund managers of index trackers also known as passive fund managers are responsible for managing investment portfolios that are designed to track the performance of a specific market index such as the sp 500 or the nasdaq composite these managers do not attempt to outperform the market by selecting individual stocks or other securities to include in the portfolio instead they aim to match the performance of the underlying index as closely as possible by investing in all of the securities that make up the index in the same proportions as they are represented in the indexto achieve this goal passive fund managers typically use a variety of investment tools and strategies including index funds exchangetraded funds etfs and other financial instruments that allow them to replicate the performance of the underlying index they also use various portfolio construction techniques such as rebalancing and optimization to ensure that the portfolio remains aligned with the indexoverall the primary role of a passive fund manager is to manage the portfolio in a way that allows it to track the performance of the underlying index as closely as possible while also minimizing costs and maximizing returns for investors,1
when a movie is played back at a higher frame rate than it was recorded the extra frames are typically created by duplicating some of the original frames so for example if a movie was recorded at 24 frames per second and is played back at 60 frames per second each original frame would be shown on screen for a shorter period of time and then repeated two or three more times before the next original frame is shownnnthe audio track of the movie is not affected by this process so it will still be played back at the same rate it was recorded this means that the audio and the video will be slightly out of sync with the audio running slightly ahead of the videonnto fix this the movies audio track can be sped up slightly so that it matches the faster frame rate of the video this will cause the audio to sound slightly higher pitched but it will still be in sync with the video alternatively the video can be slowed down slightly so that it matches the audio this will cause the video to appear slightly slower but the audio and video will be in syncnnoverall the process of keeping the audio and video in sync when playing a movie at a higher frame rate involves making slight adjustments to either the audio or the video so that they both match the desired frame rate,1

when we smell something we are detecting molecules that are released into the air these molecules are small enough to enter our noses and reach a special part of our brain called the olfactory bulb the olfactory bulb is responsible for detecting and interpreting these molecules as different smellsnnsometimes when we taste something we also smell it at the same time this is because the molecules that we smell can also affect how we perceive the taste of something for example if you are eating a piece of fruit and you hold your nose closed the fruit might taste sweet but if you open your nose and take a deep breath while you eat the fruit you might be able to taste other flavors in addition to the sweetness this is because the molecules that give the fruit its other flavors are being released into the air and are being detected by your olfactory bulb which is helping you to taste the fruit more fully,1
yes  light does reflect off everything  but there is a difference  light hitting a flat  rough surface is scattered in all directions  some of the light from  this  part of the surface happens to get directed towards your eye  as does some of the light from  that  part of the surface  and some from  that  part  and so on  in turn  that light has come from all sorts of different directions before hitting the surface  so when you re looking at a rough surface  you re seeing the reflections of just about everything in front of the surface  so you do nt see anything clearly  now  the difference is with a mirror is that it is very flat and smooth  this means it reflects each  piece  of light that hits it in one direction only  unlike the rough surface  what this means that the light you see when looking at a particular spot on the mirror has come from  one  particular spot in the area in which you are standing and then been reflected in the direction of your eye  so  when you look in a mirror  you see the scene around you clearly  whereas most other surfaces mess it up and you do nt see anything  like you said most things reflect light  the green piece of broccoli in front of you only reflects the green parts of the visible light while the rest gets absorbed  a mirror reflects all the colors of visible light  now why do nt you see a green reflection of yourself in the piece of broccoli  it s because the surface of the broccoli is not very smooth and the light is reflected at different angles and is kind of all over the place  the light is scattered  the surface of a mirror is very smooth so all the light coming in is reflected at the same angle  when you polish something  you make the surface more smooth  which can turn it into a mirrorlike surface  you can also try to imagine a lake  when the water is nt moving you can see a reflection of yourself but when you throw a stone in  the surface becomes uneven and then you ca nt see yourself anymore  pretty much any surface reflects some light like a mirror does  but some factors make it hard to make out a picture in the reflection on most surfaces   some objects absorb a bunch of the light  things that we think of as dark or dull   only the light that did nt get absorbed gets reflected  so the picture in the reflection is very faint  if you look at a  flat  surface like a painted wall or a piece of paper up close  you ll see that its surface is made up of many bumpy ridges  different parts of which are facing in all different directions  the direction light bounces when it hits a surface depends on the angle of the surface  so on these bumpy surfaces the light will be going in all different directions   diffused    for someone trying to see an image reflected on the paper  the smallest size of the paper they can make out still has many different little bumps that are redirecting light from different directions  making the reflected image look blurry  so really  the only things that makes a mirror special are that is coated with a shiny metal surface that is really good at reflecting light  making the image very bright   and it is polished smooth  so that nearby points on the mirror reflect light in mostly the same direction  making the image very sharp  ,0
it has to do with the chemical structure of a lithium battery  the way a lithium battery works is that during operation lithium ions are removed from a lithium bearing compound from one contact  transferred across an electrolyte  and deposited on the other contact  when recharging  the process is reversed  the degradation comes from the fact that each time the cycle is performed  impurities are introduced into the structure of contacts  reducing their effectiveness  this is something that could just be googled  but lithium ion batteries do not have  charge memory   so if you re constantly plugging it in at 40 percent  it wo nt revert to that  also  a lot of the reason batteries tend to lose power is the contacts wear out  that is where leaving it fully charged can be bad  because the contacts are constantly being used  which wears them out  edit  the contacts  if i m mistaken  are where the batteries touch and can power the laptop  i ca nt seem to find a good word for it  anyway  those begin to degrade after use my laptop has two modes called  optimize for battery runtime  and  optimize for battery life span   in the latter it never charges more than 75  80  battery  i have a lenovo y  series for those wondering ,0
black americans are called african americans because they are descendants of people who were brought to the united states from africa as slaves they are americans but they are also descended from african ancestors and have a shared history and cultural heritage that ties them to africa the term african american is used to recognize this history and heritage and to acknowledge the unique experience of being black in america it is not meant to diminish the fact that black americans are americans or to suggest that they are not fully part of american society rather it is a way of honoring and recognizing the contributions and struggles of black americans and the central role that they have played in the history and culture of the united states,1

there is a subtle difference between the division of canada into provinces and the us into states  and that s a matter of history  canada s independence from england was peaceful  especially compared to the us   and so their system of government hews closely to the precedent set by england  they have a stronger federal government than the us does  and  like england  an uncodified constitution   which does nt mean that their constitution is totally unwritten  just that the federal government can rule on the basis of unwritten customs rather than following the constitution to the letter   the united states made the effort to break completely from the system of government used in england  and the first major result of this was the articles of confederation  which was the system of government we had before the current constitution was written  under the articles  states were almost entirely independent entities  with only a weak federal government to handle interstate affairs and maintain a military  this worked about as well as one would expect  the result  though  is that when the constitution was written  the states tried to maintain this level of autonomy  this resulted in the 10th amendment  which states that all powers not  explicitly  given to the federal government are reserved for the states and people  in other words  in the united states   only  the state governments can make laws not specifically provided for by the constitution  whereas in canada the federal government can  in practice  provinces and states are similar  but in principle there is a subtle distinction  a state in the united states is much more like a sovereign country which has agreed to grant some powers to the federal government  whereas the provinces of canada are geographical divisions which are granted powers by the federal government  tldr  in the states  power is granted from the bottom up  in the provinces  power is granted from the top down  quebec  as always  has to be different  but that s enough needless detail for one comment  edit  much as i appreciate finally getting some decent karma on this reddit thing  i really do nt deserve to be the top rated comment in this thread  as my answer does nt really answer the question and only adds a bit of context to the other ones   u  classicsat   url1  gave a good  if brief  answer to the actual question  and  u  needlessrings   url0  said what i said better than i said it  in the us each state has a governor while the equivalent position is a premier in canada  the us has a lower house of congressmen  women while canadas lower house has members of parliment  mps   their numbers are representational of population  1 congressman per district and 1 mp per riding  both canada and us have an upper house called senate where ever province state is equally represented  in many ways they are similar in style but their legal and economic authorities are quite different  they are a subnational geographic entity  in that sense they are very much like states  and they have their own elected parliaments again  much like states  but the structure of power between the provinces and the federal government in canada is very different than in the us  basically  like the us canada is a collection of former colonies  several semi autonomous colonies that had various powers  along with territories  in the legal sense  which were largely uninhabited tracts of land which were eventually settled and incorporated into a larger political entity  canada retains 3 territories  the yukon  the northwest territories  out of which much canada was gradually carved  and the newest edition  nunavut  each of the territories has less than 40k people and they are less powerful than full provinces  this is much like the territories that became states in the us  and something akin to peurto rico   canada also  like the us incorporates former territorties and independent countries  quebec  taken from the french  and partially reorganized  before confederation  and newfoundland and labrador  one political entity  which at one point competed with canada as one of the prime imperial dominions  both are full provinces though quebec makes an effort to have more powers than the provinces  the canadian federal government is actually quite a bit smaller than it s us counterpart  the us federal government is up around 23  24  of gdp  the canadian federal government is around 15   but this is where our countries differ quite a lot  in canada the federal government makes law  except in areas specifically delegated as provincial authority  this means almost by definition that any new government responsibility first belongs to the federal government  and can then be devolved to the provinces   if the federal parliament demands that provinces provide healthcare then the provinces provide healthcare  this has led to some utterly bizarre quirks of the relationship between the federal and provincial governments  the federal government mandates something  and then to make sure the provinces can all provide healthcare equally it does this utterly ridiculous transfer payment arrangement where money for healthcare gets balanced around  in some respects this whole thing  where the federal parliament can demand provinces spend money  but then shuffles money around to pay for it much much more complicated than the us system  in the us system the federal government  offers  money to states for things they would nt otherwise do  and they can and do say no  as you see with the medicaid expansion stuff from obamacare  in canada the provinces could not say no  but then the federal government would  as separate from the rest of the budget  shuffle a bunch of money around to make sure it s paid for and supported fairly  because the federal government is quite a bit smaller than the us counterpart the provinces end up borrowing a lot of money  but they do nt control the currency  the federal government does  in many ways the us system is bad  the states are the meth lab of democracy  and it poisons much of what the us tries to achieve on a regular basis  but in canada the problem is more insidious and lives in longer time horizons  when half of canadas economy was in ontario  the largest province   and more than a third of the population things were a bit easier as federal interests and ontario interests aligned  and everyone else benefited from labour mobility and open markets to sell to ontario  and then quebec which basically shares interests with ontario but speaks french  but now 25 or 30  of the economy depends on alberta and saskatchewan and manitoba  and british columbia are their own thing again  but their goals are almost opposite that of ontario and quebec  and so we have layers of complexity in trying to keep everyone happy and failing miserably  you take money from rich provinces and give it to poor ones  but then you make federal policies that make the rich richer and the poor poorer and it does no one any favours because the rich are annoyed they have to pay more  and the poor are annoyed they have to take more  this by the way has nothing to do with england  or britain  from roughly 1707  act of union  until tony blair came to power and brought in devolution in 1999 britain was a single unitary federal state with no provinces or states  only county and city governments and colonial administrations in the overseas dependencies  with some islands of no relevance thrown in on the side   scotland and wales and england were cultural differences not legal ones  then as i say  prime minister blair came along with devolution and in less than a decade unwound 5 centuries of progress in government  but that s another matter  britain  and france and spain  organized north america into several different colonies  some of them were small and settled in small waves from one part of the various empires  other places were settled with many immigrants from many places over many years  so each has its own collection of distinct histories  and some dude in a capital city drew some lines on a map that seemed to make sense at the time  called it a province  state  territory and voila  you have a collection of entities that all get glued together and reformed and re  re  reformed to suit ,0
if it costs a dollar  it actually doesnt cost more than a dollar to manufacture  you d be surprised about how cheap stuff can be bought in bulk and from the manufacturer  the crap products that are sold at dollar stores cost pennies to manufacture  the mark up at a dollar store is certainly 200  300  over the dollar store s cost from the manufacturer  if not 500 so  the dollar store sells you something for  1  the dollar store paid between 5 and 50 cents to the manufacturer  the manufacturer made 100 of them for a nickel or something equally ridiculous  edit  formatting i know someone who is a buyer for a chain of dollar stores  there are basically three groups of items in dollar stores  1  items that cost less than a dollar wholesale  these are items you might find in other stores for around a dollar as well  generic branded food items  small trinkets  etc  2  items that have a minor defect that are auctioned off for less than the cost to manufacture  companies that produce items with a small defect opt to sell for less than the cost to produce rather than trash it  it s better to recoup some of your money than none at all  3  items that were overproduced  these are items that are in storage because they made more than could be sold  this is a huge source of inventory for dollar stores  the companies do nt want to keep paying storage costs for product that will never sell  so they sell at a loss ,0
many rappers use different names as a way to express different aspects of their personality or to create a certain image or brand for themselves some rappers might use one name when they are performing or making music that is more serious or introspective and another name when they are making music that is more lighthearted or energetic using different names can also allow a rapper to experiment with different styles or genres of music without being tied to a specific persona some rappers also use different names to pay homage to their influences or to pay tribute to their heritage ultimately using different names is just a way for rappers to have fun and be creative with their music and their identity,1
yes it does  if you only drink once a day  your body will go along getting rid of water thinking   it must be really easy to get water  i just had some  i feel great  i ll get rid of it like i normally do and we can have some more later   so your body eliminates water normally  the real reason it does this is slightly more complicated   so your body gets rid of some water and suddenly you are running low and not getting enough  so your brain releases chemicals telling your kidneys to hold onto as much water as they can  and your body acts dehydrated until you drink more water  if you drink smaller amounts throughout the day  then your body only has a small excess and really does nt get rid of a lot  so your brain never gives off the signal to excessively retain water  tldr drinking it all at once will make your body act dehydrated for most of the day  drinking in small amounts throughout the day prevents this another thing to be wary of when chugging 8 cups of water in one go is  overhydration   think of all the cells in your body like bubbles  as you drink  the bubbles  cells  are surrounded by water  inside your body   and as time goes on  they slowly let small amounts of water pass through the membrane of the bubble until the levels of water inside the bubble and outside the bubble is relatively even  since this process  osmosis  takes time  drinks a ton of water all at once can actually be dangerous  if your body ca nt let the water outside the bubbles even out and disperse into the inside of the bubbles  you see overhydration  there s a lot more physiology to it  but in a nut shell  it s much better on your body to have smaller amounts throughout the day  i hope that helps answer your question  you need to drink water to replace water used for bodily functions  getting rid of waste in urine  sweat  etc  however if your body doenst need that water  it ca nt really store it  excess fluids get flushed out by your kidneys and their really good at it  drinking 8 cups in one sitting will make you piss like a racehorse shortly after and then you ll be thirsty later  you also do nt need to drink 8 cups in a day anyways  you ll get a fair bit of water from food  and other fluids totally count to that number as well ,0
the energy in the bonds of fat molecules are used up  and most of the mass is basically exhaled as carbon dioxide  fat is your body s fuel reserve  most of your metabolism is powered by carbohydrates  but they ca nt be stored long  term  by using more calories than are provided by the sugars that are immediately available  your body taps this fuel reserve and begins to deplete it  as to your question of where the fat actually goes  it s converted into energy  new cells  and waste products  the bulk of this waste is breathed out as carbon dioxide  and the rest is excreted through urine and sweat  i love the explanation to this  because the simplest conclusion is  you exhale your fat ass  ,0

ubuntu user here  i ve had at least one rig running ubuntu for the last 4  5 years  the recent releases have been getting worse and worse in terms of user interface and program compatibility  after all this time using some windows programs in wine  the two latest releases have been getting glitchy while trying to handle emulators  besides that  codec compatibility has been getting shoddy  certain drivers  video  audio  hardware  etc   have been having recognition issues  and office  production programs have been removed completely  it s getting to the point where i m starting to back up all of my data in the cloud  so that if the next build does nt fix certain issues i ve been having  i m installing windows back onto my ubuntu rig  i could dual  boot  but then the redundancy in music  video files will take up all of my hard drive space  there s also a file system formatting issue i ve been having  but that could just be me  if you go back and look at how liinux distro s are packaged  you ll see that they are all essentially packaged in the same way  while aspects like the package manager and other core components might be different almost all linux distro s come with a gnome  kde and xfce flavor and roughly the same set of applications  from ubuntu 410  the 1st ubuntu release  to ubuntu 1010  ubuntu kept up with this constancy  of front end applications and simply added tweaks here and there to improve usability  however since ubuntu 1104  the point at which they introduced unity as the standard desktop environment   they started to stray from that code of consistency and started to develop their own in  house applications  like unity  that were only available to ubuntu  this proceeded until now when canonical is releasing mobile versions of ubuntu and planning on a unified code base across desktop and mobile devices  this is pissing off users because everyone was used to ubuntu being a certain way  doing things a certain way that was in keeping with other linux distro s  now with all the changes  many users are finding it difficult to get used to the new interface and all the changes that have been hurdled at them in the past year  another reason everyone s pissed is that ubuntu linux is ceasing to be ubuntu linux but rather just ubuntu  kind of like apple os back in the 90 s   and the part that make everyone mad is that their taking all their popularity with them  of the consumer oem s that ship linux on their machine s  almost all ship ubuntu  while this played a big role in boosting the reputability of linux in the past  if ubuntu keeps going on their path of change  all the credibility will be going to ubuntu  canonical and not other linux distro s  now to step back from the negative  while tons of users are pissed about what canonical is doing  its still reason to be excited  ubuntu has gone from taking baby steps in the past to now huge steps towards future goals  canonical has been talking about moving ubuntu to a hybrid rolling  point  release structure which will make it much more accessible for standard users  you will no longer have to upgrade your os every 6  months to stay on top of updates  and with a unified mobile  desktop code base we might actually have a viable alternative to windows 8 in a year or so  while unity is something to get used to  its no train  wreck like metro   additionally  with the expansion of the ubuntu software center  we will probably see a mass of commercial software come to linux in the next couple of years  idioticplatypus is somewhat correct  but in terms of linux distros in general ubuntu is quite stable  it has a lot of backing and seamless driver support for common hardware  i know a lot of people are annoyed at canonical s attitude towards linux  ie treating it like a business when much of the limux community is for absolutely non corporate and community based software  canonical are often pushing phones and tablets and have included amazon ads in the ubuntu software centre  i do nt think it s too bad at all though  compared to other major operating systems   ubuntu is completely open to the user and provides a great  friendly experience ,0

instead of everyone paying extra taxes  everyone has to buy health insurance  unless you ca nt afford it  it s a privatized version of our  canada s  healthcare  the  universal  healthcare systems in european countries are available to anybody  citizens and non  citizens  each countries healthcare is payed by taxpayers in their respective countries   the aca  obamacare  is a government  mandated insurance for all us citizens  while insurance is technically optional  choosing to forgo insurance will incur a tax penalty when that individual files their taxes   the aca  obamacare  made three major changes in health care in the united states  1  it expanded medicaid for those states that opted in  this is colloquially know as the medicaid expansion because the eligibility requirements for medicaid was raised  what is unique about medicaid is that it is funded by both the state and federal government  the additional expenses for the medicaid expansion are being 98  funded by the federal government so it costs the states almost nothing to opt in  2  it adopted a  10 essential benefits   url0  policy that all insurance providers must offer and removed all pre  existing condition clauses and pre  existing condition penalties with the exception of smoking  3  it required all us citizens to have health insurance  otherwise an individual will have to pay a tax penalty for themselves and any uninsured dependants  aside from these two changes  the medical industry still operates on a capitalist ideology  all us citizens can sign up for insurance through each states health exchange website where prices are negotiated at the state level or  if a state opted out of the aca  they can sign up for insurance through the marketplace which is operated at a federal level   the biggest difference between the us and european model is that you still have to individual insurance in the us  i think it s brilliant  i live in the uk and find it hard to see any reason why you would nt want it  i can understand that a privatised health care system  should  offer better care but on the flip side  the nhs answers to the people and has no shareholders to impress  in other discussions i have heard people say stuff like  i never get sick so why should i pay to support others   but all it takes is one accident to put you massively in debt and potentially ruin your life  i only know the basics of obamacare but it seems like a bizarre system to me  what happens if you have no insurance  are single  have no family and then fall into a coma  do they pull the plug fairly quickly or do they wait til you wake up and slap you with a massive bill  what happens if a homeless man gets cancer  does he just have to wait until he dies without any care at all  i m not trying to have a dig  i m just looking to broaden my knowledge  edit  i seem to have misread the question  i thought it was a discussion on the pros and cons rather than the differences  apologies ,0
most of the time repressed memories are false memories created by an unskilled therapist  url0 others have covered that  repressed memories  are usually fake  but the interesting thing is the  why   it turns out your brain is more than capable of  creating  memories  given enough prompting  when you re walked through things step by step  your brain is more than happy to create a memory of that thing happening   here   url0  is an article all about the different ways your brain can create totally false memories  i ve only taken some basic psychology classes  but its my understanding that there is no such thing as a repressed memory  i believe freud came up with the idea  which was revolutionary for its time  but in the end most of his work is now considered obsolete ,0
sure so humans have been around for a very long time and for most of that time they lived in small groups as huntergatherers this means that they would move around to find food shelter and other resources rather than staying in one placennas humans learned to work together and share resources they started to form bigger groups and build more permanent settlements this was the beginning of civilization but building a civilization takes a lot of work and requires many different skills such as farming building and trading it also requires people to come up with new ideas and ways of doing thingsnnall of this takes time and it wasnt until about 47 thousand years ago that humans had developed the skills and knowledge necessary to build the first civilizations so even though humans have been around for a long time it has taken us a while to figure out how to build and maintain civilizations,1

horsepower is roughly the amount of work that can be sustained by one horse  that is lifting 75 kg against the force of gravity  750 watts or 550 foot pounds per second   there s a muscle car saying that exclaims  there s no replacement for displacement   that means a big engine makes lots of power  big engine is measured in displacement and it is the size of the combustion chamber  in other words  how big is the container that you will be filling with air  gasoline and sparking to explode  a car with four cylinders the size of a coffee cup can only fit so much explosive power  but a car with eight similar sized cylinders can fit much more  if you increase the size to that of an extra large coffee instead of a small  there is much more air  gas and therefore a bigger explosion  you can increase the size by making the cylinder wider  bore  or longer  stroke   then there are all kinds of little tweaks you can do such as igniting the air  gas mixture sooner or later in the stroke  shaping the head of the cylinder  the legendary hemi is a hemispherical top   in a car  hp is measured by parking the vehicle with the drive wheels on a spinning drum  called a dynomometer  when you drive the car  the dyno measures the power it s receiving and that s the hp  horsepower is related to quite a few factors in engines  but to put it into basics  the more air and fuel you can put in the engine at the right ratio  the more power you can get out of the engine  if you think of the optimal air  fuel mix in a petrol engine as a gas  you can get more of that gas in by increasing the size of the cylinders  forcing more air into the engine in some way  making it revolve faster  or getting the gas mix to burn more efficiently  now certain countries use brake horsepower to measure car engines  in europe we use kilowatts or ps  metric horsepower  but they are all describing how much turning force the engine can apply over time  the headline horsepowers you see in car brochures is the maximum horsepower at whatever rpm the engine was doing when it hit maximum horsepower  it s directly related to torque  in lbs  ft the formula is  hp   torque  rpm   5252 it does nt always fit that a high torque engine has more horsepower though  for instance diesel engines have high torque but can have low horsepower because they ca nt revolve fast  equally  fast revving motorbike engines are small in size  have relatively little torque  but have a lot of power   here s a handy infographic    url0 ,0

psychologists and psychiatrists often do work together in the field of mental health psychologists are trained to diagnose and treat mental health conditions using various therapies such as cognitivebehavioral therapy or psychodynamic therapy psychiatrists on the other hand are medical doctors who specialize in mental health they are trained to diagnose and treat mental health conditions using medications as well as provide therapy both psychologists and psychiatrists can play important roles in helping people with mental health issues working together allows them to use their different areas of expertise to provide the most comprehensive and effective treatment possible for example a psychologist may work with a patient to help them understand and change negative thought patterns using therapy while a psychiatrist may prescribe medication to help alleviate symptoms of a mental health condition its important to note that both psychologists and psychiatrists are highly trained professionals who are able to help people with mental health issues its not necessarily a matter of one being better than the other but rather a matter of using the skills and knowledge of both to provide the best possible care to patients,1
the basic concept is that you decide on details regarding implementation and testing while developing  in more classical methodologies you generally spend a lot of time in the beginning of a project to plan everything on a high detail before writing the first line of code  in agile developement you make a very rough plan and decide the details as you go along  it is more of a  try and error  method that is a lot more flexible but have some other drawbacks  software test analyst here  i work for an outsourcing company  so have had the pleasure of seeing how dozens of different web and application developers apply the theory of agile testing  as someone has mentioned  it is widely accepted as the process of test and development taking place together  allowing for quick response and change to fix defects and change design where testers can prove an issue with the current design  good developers will do this in little sections called  sprints   these are basically periods where a specific area is focused on for testing and development over a given period of time  you get everything as good as you can in that period and then move on to the next sprint  this helps projects move forward and avoids getting bogged down trying to perfect overly specific areas  bad developers will use it an excuse for constantly moving the goalposts and covering up a lack of planning and design  often the solution specification or functional specification i m given is far from the final design  or just completely lacks any real detail  i ve seen specifications range from hundreds of pages of beautiful quantifiable accurate information  down to 5 bullet points on a single page  you just never know  finally  it s often the best method for client delivery  as it allows clients to tweak and adapt their requirements during development  if they suddenly want a new feature  it can be adapted into an upcoming sprint and tested quickly for functionality  in reality  agile covers a broad range of styles  often  as a tester  you are coming into a project with numerous deadlines looming  so you end up quickly in a high pressured environment  with people expecting you to be able to finely comb through every aspect of their application looking for defects  this is where it pays off to have a comprehensive specification to refer to  and just as importantly to have developers who are happy to explain things in simple terms to you at a moments notice  as a hardware engineer who does the occasional bit of firmware development  it s a fancy way of saying  make it up as you go along   i ve never seen it explained in a way that does nt make me think that s exactly what it is  the exception to that is  our customers keep changing their minds about what they want so we have to just make it up as we go along ,0

it is more complex in some ways  but chinese characters address a very serious problem in communication  in a phonetic written system  the writing can be interpreted into sounds and those sounds can be interpreted into ideas  you are using your knowledge of a spoken language to allow your written language to be simple  in a logographic writing system  symbols can be interpreted directly into ideas without an intervening spoken language  this means that two people who speak different languages but understand the same symbols and syntax can communicate without ever needing to learn the other s spoken language  this has the drawback of complexity  but the advantage of easier communication with a wider community once the written language is known  there are definitely different dialects  although efforts at uniformity have occurred from time to time to combat language drift  for example  the japanese use an occasionally different set of chinese characters combined with structures from two different japanese alphabets to create a different grammar and a system for integrating foreign words which does nt use new symbols  like any language  i m sure it simply evolved to the way it is now  i highly doubt that a specific  someone  sat around with his or her buddies and said   we must make our language complex  so as to confound diizzyv2   chinese is really easy to learn however it s been 8 years since i first learned it and forgotten most of it  they use characters to represent things and ideas  one character means  man  and another would be  holy place   if you wrote them side by side you have a  man in a holy place  if you combine them you get  holy man  or  priest   they have a somewhat but not an alphabet of all the characters they use  once you learn them then it s how they are used or combined that tells the story or what something is  one sentence in english can be said in 2 characters in chinese  i do recall that they are diffrent dialects and 3 version of chinese  mandarin  cantonese and idonese  not sure on this spelling on this one   mandarin is china s official common language  cantonese is considered like southern american a hick language and the other is medical legal  each character has specific pronunciations and ascents  a word spelled in english as ru may have 8 ways of saying it and each is initially a word or thing like present tense  read  and past tense  read  is pronounced diffrent but in mandarin would mean two completely different things  note  my grammar and spelling sucks so i am sorry ,0
when you use a credit card you are borrowing money from the credit card company to make a purchase you will need to pay back the borrowed amount plus any interest at a later date on the other hand when you use a debit card the money is being taken directly from your bank account to make the purchasernrnin general it is a good idea to care about whether you are using a credit card or a debit card because using credit cards responsibly can help you build a good credit score which can be useful in the future when you want to borrow money for a big purchase like a house or a car on the other hand if you use a credit card irresponsibly and dont pay your balance in full every month you could end up with a high amount of debt and a low credit score which could make it difficult for you to borrow money in the futurernrnso to summarize if you are able to use a credit card responsibly and pay off your balance in full every month it can be a good option for you however if you are not able to do this it might be better for you to stick with a debit card which allows you to only spend the money you have available in your bank account,1
unexpected dividends are dividends that are paid to shareholders by a company without prior announcement or indication these dividends can be paid for a variety of reasons such as a company having excess profits or wanting to distribute its wealth to shareholders unexpected dividends can be a positive surprise for shareholders as they can provide a sudden and unexpected increase in the return on their investmentit is important to note that unexpected dividends are not the same as special dividends which are dividends that are paid in addition to a companys regular dividends and are typically announced in advance special dividends may be paid for a variety of reasons such as a company having a onetime windfall or wanting to distribute a portion of its wealth to shareholdersif you are interested in financial data quandl is a great resource it is a financial data platform that offers a wide range of financial and economic data from a variety of sources including exchanges brokers governments and central banks you can use quandl to access data on a wide range of financial instruments including stocks bonds futures options and more you can also use quandl to perform analysis and build financial models,1
pumping weights also known as lifting weights or weight training is a type of exercise that helps people build strength and muscle when you lift weights your muscles have to work against the weight of the weights which helps them get stronger if you just hold a weight in the air without moving it your muscles wont have to work as hard so you wont get as much benefit from the exercise picking up a weight and holding it up can be a good way to start building strength but it wont be as effective as lifting and lowering the weight repeatedly because your muscles will get tired more quickly and wont have to work as hard to get the most benefit from weight lifting its best to lift and lower the weights in a controlled way using good form to protect your muscles and joints,1
from what i have seen  it will slowly end the medicaid expansion  this is the part of the aca that helped low income people afford healthcare  it will allow  worse  plans to be sold to people who do nt want to pay for the more comprehensive plans in the current aca marketplace  this benefits younger  healthier people  however  people who really need healthcare but can now only afford these substandard plans  they will not have the same coverage as with the aca  it removes the tax on people who do not have healthcare  however  if you drop your healthcare coverage  and then decide that you want healthcare  you pay a tax  so the mandate is  sort of  there  1  it gets rid of the mandate  that means that if you do nt have health care  you do nt have to pay a penalty on your taxes  it does penalize people for letting their insurance lapse  with a 30  increase if they rejoin   so it incentives continuous coverage  2  it begins to reduce the medicaid expansion starting in 2020  3  ties subsidies  tax credits to age rather than income  and allows insurance to charge higher rates for old people than they can now  4  it increases the income level for subsidies to  75000 for an individual and  150000 for a household  by contrast  an individual making over  48000 gets no subsidy currently  and the other numbers depend on people in the household   5  the gop plan does not allow medicaid money to go to planned parenthood  6  it allows insurance companies and individuals to sign up for plans that do nt provide the same minimum coverage that the aca requires  basically  young and healthy people can buy more of a bare bones plan if they want to  7  finally  large employers would not be required to provide insurance to employees  i think the worst part of aca is the mandate and high premium costs and especially the high deductibles  honestly  i do nt see how anyone can make it with a  10000 deductible  i m fortunate to be in the higher income range and i do nt think we could handle that  it s not like you can take out a loan to meet your deductibles  bad stuff ,0
social policies mixed with capitalism have been proven to work very well together  this includes the united states  canada  and many european countries  pure socialism  public ownership of  all  means of production  has never been properly implemented  capitalism comes with many inherent flaws  and a  mixed  approach which applies social control over some aspects of the economy seeks to remedy those flaws  nearly every socialist country has given it up after experiencing a string of economic failures  the most notable example is the soviet union  another interesting example is china  which still calls itself communist but is in fact a large percentage capitalist  both of these countries experienced not only poverty  but even starvation of millions of people  as a result of their failed economic policies during socialism  pretty much every democratic country that collects taxes and uses tax money to fund things like infrastructure  healthcare  public education  etc is socializing the costs of all of those things  so i would argue that some socialist principles work out pretty good in the long run ,0
okay  explained like you re a five year  old  well  okay  maybe a bit older   without too much oversimplification  and  hopefully  without sounding too biased  what people call  obamacare  is actually the patient protection and affordable care act  abbreviated to ppaca or aca   however  people were calling it  obamacare  before everyone even hammered out what it would  be   it s a term that was  at first  mostly used by people who did nt like the ppaca  and it s become popularized in part because ppaca is a really long and awkward name  even when you turn it into an acronym like that  barack obama has since said that he actually  likes  the term  obamacare  because  he says   i do care   anyway  the ppaca made a bunch of new rules regarding health care  with the purpose of making health care more affordable for everyone  opponents of the ppaca  on the other hand  feel that the rules it makes take away too many freedoms and force people  both individuals and businesses  to do things they should nt have to  so what does it do  well  here is everything  in the order of when it goes into effect  because some of it happens later than other parts of it    note  page numbers listed in

 question    what determines whether or not i can afford the mandate  will i be forced to pay for insurance i ca nt afford    answer    there are all kinds of checks in place to keep you from getting screwed  kaiser actually has a webpage with a pretty good rundown on it  if you re worried about it  you can see it  here   url4   okay  have we got that settled  okay  moving on   medicaid can now be used by everyone up to 133  of the poverty line  basically  a  lot  more poor people can get insurance    citation  page 198  sec  2001   url26    note  the  recent court ruling   url54  says that states can opt out of this and that the federal government can not penalize them by withholding medicaid funding  but as far as i can tell  nothing is stopping the federal government from simply just offering incentives to those who  do  opt to do it  instead   small businesses get some tax credits for two years   it looks like this is specifically for businesses with 25 or fewer employees    citation  page 157  sec  1421   url5    businesses with over 50 employees must offer health insurance to full  time employees  or pay a penalty    citation  page 174  sec  4980h   url51     question    ca nt businesses just fire employees or make them work part  time to get around this requirement  also  what about businesses with multiple locations    answer    yes and no  switching to part  time only wo nt help to get out of the requirement  as the affordable care act counts the hours worked  not the number of full  time employees you have  if your employees worked an equivalent of 50 full  time employees  hours  the requirement kicks in  really  the only plausible way a business could reasonably utilize this strategy is if they currently operate with  just  over the 50  employee number  and could still operate with under 50 employees  and have no intention to expand  also  regarding the questions about multiple locations   this   url46  legal website analyzed the law and claims that multiple locations in one chain all count as a part of the same business  meaning employers like wal  mart ca nt get around this by being under 50 employees in one store  they d have to be under that for the entire  chain   which just ai nt happening   independently  owned franchises are different  however  as they have a separate owner and as such are nt included under the same net as the parent company  however  any individual franchise with over 50 employees  will  have to meet the requirement  having said that  the aca only requires employers to offer insurance to full  time employees  so theoretically they could get out of this by reducing all employees to 29 hours or fewer a week  however  if any employees  hours go above that  their employer will have to provide insurance or pay the penalty  and also  this is putting aside how an employer only offering part  time work with no insurance will affect how competitive they are on the job market  especially when small businesses with 25 or fewer employees actually get that aforementioned tax credit to help pay for insurance if they choose to get it  though they are not required to provide insurance    insurers now ca nt do annual spending caps  their customers can get as much health care in a given year as they need    citation  page 33  sec  2711   url15    limits how high of an annual deductible insurers can charge customers

spending  which in turn are put right back into medicare to increase its solvency  most notably  this bill reduces the amount that medicare advantage pays to be more in line with other areas of medicare  citation   page 384  sec  3201   url29  and  page 389  sec  3202   url11    and reduces the growth of medicare payments in the future   citation  page 426  sec  3402   url8    the non  partisan congressional budget office estimates that between 2012 and 2022  this will amount to  716 billion in reduced spending   citation  cbo estimate   url36    also being cut is  22 billion from the medicare improvement fund  most likely because the ppaca does a lot of the same stuff  so that spending would be redundant   citation  page 361  sec  3112   url21     place a  2500 limit on tax  free spending on fsas  accounts for medical spending   basically  people using these accounts now have to pay taxes on any money over  2500 they put into them    citation  page 820  sec  9005   url61

  url47    congress and congressional staff will only be offered the same insurance offered to people in the insurance exchanges  rather than federal insurance  basically  we wo nt be footing their health care bills any more than any other american citizen    citation  page 100  sec  1312   url57    a new tax on pharmaceutical companies   a new tax on the purchase of medical devices   a new tax on insurance companies based on their market share  basically  the more of the market they control  the more they ll get taxed   raises the bar for how much your medical expenses must cost before you can start deducting them from your taxes  thanks to redditor cnash6 for the correction      112015    doctors  pay will be determined by the quality of their care  not how many people they treat    edit    arealmd addresses questions regarding this one in far more detail and with far more expertise than i can offer in  this post   url27   if you re looking for a more in  depth explanation of this one  as many of you are   i highly recommend you give his post a read    112017    if any state can come up with their own plan  one which gives citizens the same level of care at the same price as the ppaca  they can ask the secretary of health and human resources for permission to do their plan instead of the ppaca  so if they can get the same results without  say  the mandate  they can be allowed to do so  vermont  for example  has expressed a desire to just go straight to single  payer  in simple terms  everyone is covered  and medical expenses are paid by taxpayers     citation  page 117  sec  1332   url58     2018    all health care plans must now cover preventive care  not just the new ones    a new tax on  cadillac  health care plans  more expensive plans for rich people who want fancier coverage     citation  page 812  sec  9001   url35 2     2020    the elimination of the  medicare gap   aaaaand that s it right there  the biggest thing opponents of the bill have against it is the mandate  they claim that it forces people to buy insurance  and forcing people to buy something is unconstitutional  personally  i take the opposite view  as it s not telling people to buy a specific thing  just to have a specific type of thing  just like a part of the money we pay in taxes pays for the police and firemen who protect us  this would have us paying to ensure doctors can treat us for illness and injury  plus  as previously mentioned  it s necessary if you re doing away with  pre  existing conditions  because otherwise no one would get insurance until they needed to use it  which defeats the purpose of insurance  of course  because so many people are arguing about it  and some of the people arguing about it do nt really care whether or not what they re saying is true  there are a lot of things people think the bill does that just are nt true  here s a few of them    obamacare has death panels     that sounds so cartoonishly evil it must be true  right  well  no  no part of the bill says anything about appointing people to decide whether or not someone dies  the decision over whether or not your claim is approved is still in the hands of your insurer  however  now there s an appeals process so if your claim gets turned down  you can challenge that  and the government watches that appeals process to make sure it s not being unfair to customers  so if anything the ppaca is trying to  stop  the death panels    citation  page 42  sec  2719   url40     what about the independent medicare advisory board  death panels     the independent medicare advisory board  which has had its name changed to independent payment advisory board  or ipab  is intended to give recommendations on how to save medicare costs per person  deliver more efficient and effective care  improve access to services  and eliminate waste  however  they have no real power  they put together a recommendation to put before congress  and congress votes on it  and the president has power to veto it  what s more  they are specifically told that their recommendation will not ration health care  raise premiums or co  pays  restrict benefits  or restrict eligibility  in other words  they need to find ways to save money  without  reducing care for patients  so no death panels  in any sense of the  stupid  term    citation  page 426  sec  3403   url8     obamacare has health care rationing      rationing  is just a fancier way of saying  death panels   and no  it does nt   see above     obamacare has an un  elected panel of people who will decide what kind of care i can get     yet another way of saying  death panels   albeit a softer way of saying it  it s true that the ipab is appointed  not elected  however  they are expressly forbidden from reducing or rationing care   again  see above     obamacare gives free insurance to illegal immigrants     actually  there are multiple parts of the bill that specifically state that the recipient of tax credits and other good stuff  must  be a legal resident of the united states  and while the bill does nt specifically forbid illegals from buying insurance or getting treated at hospitals  neither did the laws in the us before the ppaca  so even at worst  illegals still have just as much trouble getting medical care as they used to    citations  page 141  sec  1402   url14    page 142  sec  1411   url50    page 144  sec  1411   url56    page 151  sec  1412   url37     obamacare uses taxpayer money for abortions     one part of the bill says  essentially  that the folks who wrote this bill are nt touching that issue with a ten foot pole  it basically passes the buck on to the states  who can choose to allow insurance plans that cover abortions  or they can choose to not allow them  obama may be pro  choice  but that is not reflected in the ppaca    citation  page 64  sec  1303   url45     obamacare forces churches  taxpayers to pay for women to have free birth control     this claim refers to  page 33  sec  2713   url15   which says that health insurance must include preventive care for women supported by the health resources and services administration  and that administration  on the recommendation of the independent institute of medicine of the national academy of science  has determined that preventive care for women should include access to well women visits  domestic violence screening  and  yes  contraception  so insurers  do  have to provide these services  and no  they  can not  require their insured to pay for them  this is because birth control  particularly its effects on hormones and stuff  are very important to the health of some women   but what if i  as a taxpayer  do nt want to pay for it   you ask  you do nt  it s provided by the health insurance company  not the government   but what about employers who provide employee plans  does that mean a church would have to pay for the birth control of its clergy   you ask  the answer is  no   on february 10  2012  or february 15th  if you go by the header in the document   the department of health and human services issued  this document   url3   detailing its enforcement of that section of the aca   kaiser   url38  has given their own interpretation of this  the short version is  churches and houses of worship are exempt from this rule  period  other religious employers  like catholic hospitals  are also exempt until august 2013  by which time insurance providers are to have created special plans specifically for them  that put all the costs of contraception on the insurer  with none on the employee  or  the employer  so not one cent of taxpayer money is going towards contraception  nor is a single cent of a church s money paying for contraception either  birth control is to be provided to women  by the insurer     obamacare wo nt let me keep the insurance i have     the ppaca actually very specifically says you can keep the insurance you have if you want    citation  page 74  sec  1251   url64     obamacare will make the government get between me and my doctor     the ppaca very specifically says that the secretary of health and human services  who is in charge of much of the bill   is absolutely not to promote any regulation that hinders a patient s ability to get health care  to speak with their doctor  or have access to a full range of treatment options    citation  page 184  sec  1554   url59     obamacare has a public option  that makes it bad     the public option  which would give people the  option  of getting insurance from a government  run insurer  thus the name   whether you like it or not  was taken out of the bill before it was passed  you can still see where it  used  to be  though    citation  page 111  sec  1323  the first one    url2     obamacare will cost trillions and put us in massive debt     the ppaca will cost a lot of money  at first   17 trillion  yikes  right  but that s just to get the ball rolling  you see  amongst the things built into the bill are new taxes  on insurers  pharmaceutical companies  tanning salons  and a slight increase in taxes on people who make over  200 k  an increase of less than 1    additionally  the bill cuts some stuff from medicare that s not really working  and generally tries to make everything work more efficiently  also  the increased focus on preventative care  making sure people do nt get sick in the first place   should help to save money the government already spends on emergency care for these same people  basically  by catching illnesses early  we re not spending as much on emergency room visits  according to the congressional budget office  who studies these things  the ultimate result is that this bill will reduce the yearly deficit by  109 billion   source   url17    by the year 2021  the bill will actually have paid itself and started  bringing in  more money than it cost    obamacare is twice as long as war and peace     war and peace is 587287 words long  the patient protection and affordable care act  depending on which version you re referring to  is between 300000  400000 words long  do nt get me wrong  it s still very long  but it s not as long as war and peace  also  it bears mention that bills are often long  in 2005  republicans passed the safe  accountable  flexible  efficient transportation equity act  a legacy for users  2005  which was almost as long as the ppaca  and no one raised a stink about it    the people who passed obamacare did nt even read it     are you kidding  they had been reading it over and over for a half a year  this thing was being tossed around in debates for ages  and it went through numerous revisions  but every time it was revised  it was just adding  removing  or changing small parts of it  not rewriting the whole thing  and every time it was revised  the new version of the bill was published online for everyone to see  the final time it was edited  there may not have been time to re  read the entire thing before voting on it  but there was nt a  need  to  because everyone had already read it all  the only thing people needed to read was the revision  which there was plenty of time to do    pelosi said something like   we ll have to pass the bill before reading it      the actual quote is  we have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it  away from the fog of controversy   and she s talking about all the lies and false rumors that were spreading about it  things had gotten so absurd that by this point many had given up on trying to have an honest dialogue about it  since people kept worrying about things that had no basis in reality  pelosi was simply trying to say that once the bill is finalized and passed  then everyone can look at it and see  without question  what is actually in the thing  as opposed to some new amendment you heard on the radio that they were going to put in     obamacare was signed quietly in the middle of the night     this is stretching the truth to the breaking point  the house version of the bill was signed on october 8  2009 at 1215 in the afternoon  and the senate version was signed on december 24  2009 at 705 in the morning  the only vote that you could argue came close to  the middle of the night  was the house vote on the changes made in the senate version of the bill  which took place at 1049 pm  on march 21  2010  a whole three months later  it was nt a vote on anything anyone had nt seen before  but on the version of the legislation passed in the senate  431 of the 435 men and women in the house of representatives voted on it    citation  url20   httpwww  url20 congress  bills111  hr3590      obamacare is a government takeover of the health industry     what do you mean by  takeover   like  for example  do you believe that because the fda regulates food to make sure that it s safe to eat  that we ve had a government takeover of food  by the same right  the affordable care act adds a lot of regulations saying how health insurers should do business  in order to make sure that more people have insurance and that their insurance works in a way that s fair and reliable  but the government themselves is nt taking over insurance  they re not selling us that insurance  the public option  which would have made a government  run insurance plan to compete with private plans  never got passed  so government is nt taking over your insurance any more than they ve taken over your food    obamacare cuts  700 billion dollars from medicare     not really  what the affordable care act  actually  does is brings medicare advantage costs back in line with regular medicare  citation   page 384  sec  3201   url29  and  page 389  sec  3202   url11    limit the growth of certain parts of medicare where our spending is outpacing what we re actually required to spend   citation  page 426  sec  3402   url8    and replaces some parts of medicare with better  more cost  effective substitutes   citation  page 361  sec  3112   url21    these accusations are based on a  report   url36  by the non  partisan congressional budget office showing the reduction of medicare costs from 2012  2022  however  the accusations fail to mention that those  cuts  will not result in reduced care  reduced enrollment  or reduced anything really  other than reduced costs to the taxpayers  which  both  democrats and republicans agree is a good idea  so much so that republicans like paul ryan even included those exact same  cuts  in their own budget plans     obamacare takes money from medicare to pay for obamacare     it absolutely does not  every penny saved by changes the affordable care act makes to medicare goes  back  into medicare  the bill itself specifically says that any of these savings must be used to increase medicare solvency  improve its services  or reduce premiums   citation  page 481  sec  3601   url42      obamacare is going to make hospitals drop support for medicare and medicaid     some doctors and hospitals are worried about some of the big changes being made to how they re paid  specifically  that medicare and medicaid are changing from compensating them for the number of patients they see to compensating them for how  well  they treat those patients  some doctors have even threatened to stop accepting medicare and medicaid  but these threats seem weak when you realize that  according to the  american hospital association   url30    medicare and medicaid account for 56 percent of all care provided by hospitals  consequently  very few hospitals can elect not to participate in medicare and medicaid   now  granted  reimbursements to hospitals under medicare are in many cases less than the cost of care  but much of what the aca does is to seek to reduce the cost of care  particularly  by  reducing recidivism  patients going back to the hospital to be treated for the same thing because they did nt get the right treatment the first time   and alarmists warning about  cuts made to medicare  can look back above  it s not being cut  it s having its growth rate reduced  and any savings go back into medicare    obamacare allows barack obama to create a secret health care army     i swear  i did not make this one up  there are actually people out there claiming this  it is pertaining to  page 562 of the bill   url43   specifically sections 5209  5210  and 203  which reduce limits on the united states public health service commissioned corps  and creates the regular corps and the ready reserve corps  what the claim gets right is that these are enlisted uniformed services  however  what these corps do is respond to disasters like hurricane katrina and the haiti earthquake  they are enlisted medical professionals that can be called up in a time of crisis  in fact  the united states public health service commissioned corps was involved in the assistance with both of those emergencies  but at that time  it was limited in size to only 2800 people  this section of the bill removes those limits so we are better  equipped to respond to emergencies like this in the future  i think those are some of the bigger ones  i ll try to get to more as i think of them  whew  hope that answers the question    edits    fixing typos    edit 2    wow  people have a lot of questions  i m afraid i ca nt get to them now  got to go to work   but i ll try to later    edit 3    okay  i m at work  so i ca nt go really in  depth for some of the more complex questions just now  but i ll try and address the simpler ones  also  a few i m seeing repeatedly   the website that was to be established  i  think   is  url32   url32    a lot of people are concerned about the 112015 bit that says that doctors  pay will be tied to quality  not quantity  because so many people want to know more about this  i ve sought out what i believe to be the pertinent sections  from page 307  section 3007   it looks like this part alters a part of another bill  the  social security act   url22   passed a long while ago  that bill already regulates how doctors  pay is determined  the ppaca just changes the criteria  judging by how professionals are writing about it    it looks like this is just referring to medicaid and medicare    basically  this is changing how much the  government  pays to doctors and medical groups  in situations where they are already responsible for pay    edit 4    numerous people are pointing out i said  medicare  when i meant  medicaid   whoops  fixed  i think     edit 5    apparently i messed up the acronym  initialism    fixed    edit 6    fixed a few more places where i mixed up terms  it was late  i was tired   also  for everyone asking if they can post this elsewhere  feel free to    edit 7    i just want to be sure to say  i m just a guy  i m no expert  and everything i posted here i attribute mostly to  wikipedia   url28  or  the actual bill itself   url44   with an occasional google search to clarify stuff  i am absolutely not a definitive source or expert  i was just trying to simplify things as best i can without dumbing them down  i m glad that many of you found this helpful    edit 8    wow  this has spread all over the internet  and i m kinda  embarrassed because what spread included all of my 2am typos and mistakes  well  it s too late to undo my mistakes now that the floodgates have opened  i only hope that people are nt too harsh on me for the stuff i ve tried to go back and correct    edit 9    added citations    edit 10    adding a few more citations  it ll probably take me a while to get to all of them  and a few more additional entries as well    edit 11    tons more citations    edit 12    i updated this with a reference to the recent court ruling on the mandate  and address the question everyone seems to be asking about it   what if i ca nt afford to buy insurance      edit 13    i ve started up a   obamacare  point  by  point   url9   where i m starting to go through the bill point by point and summarize it in the same order that everything is actually  in  the bill  so that hopefully  when i m done  you can just use my version as

i ve heard from several people that no one really knows how it works  is this true  not at all  we know very well how these things work  otherwise it would nt be possible to design them  anyway  here s an eli5 for a magnetic confinement nuclear reaction  the world is made up of matter  often this matter is attached to other matter  through stuff called bonds  you can think of it as glue that holds things together  as you heat up the matter  it will melt  think of ice melting into water  you can heat stuff enough that all the glue breaks and you re left with the smallest pieces  we call these atoms  atoms are really really tiny  if you laid 100 million of them end to end  they would be about as long as your finger is wide  assuming a 5 year old finger is 1 cm  atoms are like weird balloons  in the center there s a hard rock called a nucleus  although this rock is really small  if you can imagine an atom is the size of a football field  the nucleus would be the size of a pebble  the nucleus is made up of even smaller balls called protons and neutrons  protons are balls that have something called positive charge  neutrons have no charge  all that s important is that positive charges do nt like to be near each other  unless they re really close  they re kind of strange like that  you put them a little bit close together and they push apart  but if you get right up next to each other they ll hold each other tight  but even two protons will push each other apart if there are nt neutrons there to help out  because the nucleus only has positive charge  it is also positively charged  the rest of the atom is not empty though  it is filled with electrons  usually exactly one electron for each proton in the nucleus  the electrons have negative charge  so if you have the same amount of protons and electrons  you get zero total charge  electrons are really fast and really small so they zip around the entire atom really fast  so fast that at any point in time you really have no chance of knowing where exactly the electron is  they stay close to the atom because negatively charged things like positively charged things  so the electrons like the nucleus  you can think of them like us on earth  being held to the surface of the earth because of gravity  ok  still with me  now here s where it gets fun  if you heat up your atoms even more  then the electrons have enough energy to  escape  just like a rocket ship escaping into space  if you have a lot of electrons that are free  it means that a lot of atoms no longer have as many protons as electrons  we call this a plasma  so a plasma is made up of positively charge nuclei  more than one nucleus are called nuclei  which are really small and really light  and negatively charged electrons which are even smaller and over 1000 times lighter  the goal of fusion is to get two nuclei close enough together that they like each other enough  if you do nt get them very close they ll only see that the other nucleus has a positive charge  and they ll bounce off  if you do get them close enough together  and they re the right type of nuclei  they will form another nucleus  and in the process they will create energy   eli10 aside  in actuality the new nucleus will weigh less than the two separate nuclei  and the difference in mass is what creates the energy   how do you get them close enough together  one way is to make them really hot  if they re really hot  they re really fast  and if they re really fast  it means that they might just slam into each other before they realize that the other nucleus is positively charged also  how hot  currently  things tend to work best when we re about ten times hotter than the center of the sun  now we see the problem  the sun is so hot that it will melt everything it comes into contact with  so if we put our hot plasma in a box  it will just melt the box  so how do we hold the plasma  the answer is that we take advantage of the fact that the plasma has charge  and charged particles act strange around magnets  specifically  if you put a nucleus in a magnetic field  it will  spiral around it like a corkscrew   url2   the nucleus is free to move  along  the field  but it s really hard to move  across  it  so that leads us to the first solution  take magnetic fields and make them into circles  sort of like  this   url1   see that dashed line in the middle  if you have a nucleus sitting on this line  it will always go along the line  it does nt matter how hot it is  it will never touch the walls  this is why a lot of fusion devices look like big donuts  it turns out that this is not quite good enough  you know how when you re in the car and you go around a bend and you slide in your seat  well the same things happen to the nuclei on the magnetic field lines  eli20 it s more complicated  but this is the end result   so if you just put them in a simple donut like we showed above  eventually they will slide out and hit the wall  not good  there are a couple ways around this problem  but you mentioned the big machine in germany that s starting soon  called a  stellarator   the stellarator solution is to make it so the fields curve around the donut  it s hard to see this but this  picture   url0  might help  the blue thing in the middle of the donut is the plasma  if you look closely at it  you can see a green line  if you follow that green line around it will move from the outside to the inside and back out  that means that some of the time it s being pushed out towards the wall  and some of the time it s being pushed towards the center  so overall it stays inside the machine and does nt hit the wall  that means you can heat it up as hot as you want without melting everything   i ve heard from several people that no one really knows how it works  is this true  no  we understand how they work quite well  all the physics behind it has been well understood for decades  the problem is that we do nt know how to build efficient reactors that give off more energy than they require to run  the basic physics going on inside a reactor  though  is not a mystery  of course we know how they work  take light elements  namely hydrogen  apply heat and pressure  and they fuse into helium  if you do it right  the process releases more energy than it took to do it  fusion is nt that hard  you can build bench top devices that will do it  but they re hugely inefficient  the hard part is the more energy out than in scenario  hydrogen bombs make the big boom they do because more energy comes out than goes in  but of course  that s wildly uncontrolled  pressure and heat are related in this process  the more pressure you make  the less heat you need  fusion in the core of the sun occurs at a lower temperature than what we need in our reactors because the sun s core is under greater pressure than we can achieve in our reactors  so we compensate with higher temperatures  a fusion reactor designed for energy production would be surrounded in a water jacket that would be heated by energy escaping the reactor  and that would turn a turbine  there s one other way we could capture energy  but i forget what that is  i do nt believe it requires boiling water ,0
the mona lisa is a famous painting because it is a very good painting and it is also very old the mona lisa was painted by a famous artist named leonardo da vinci who lived a long time ago the painting is of a woman and it is very realistic and lifelike many people think it is a beautiful painting and they like to look at it it is also famous because it is very well known and many people have heard of it it is not overrated but rather it is highly regarded and admired by many people for its artistic merit and historical significance,1
the reason that men and women have different shoe size systems is because their feet are typically different sizes and shapes mens feet are generally larger and wider than womens feet so a size 8 in womens shoes would be too small for a man to wear comfortably similarly a size 65 in mens shoes would be too large for a woman to wear comfortablynnto ensure that peoples shoes fit properly its important to use the correct size system for your gender if everyone used the same scale it would be more difficult to find shoes that fit properly which could lead to discomfort or even injury,1
there are a few strategies you can consider to protect your savings from exceptional taxesdiversify your savings consider spreading your savings across multiple accounts and types of investments such as a highyield savings account a money market fund and a cd ladder this can help to reduce the impact of any potential taxes on your savingscontribute to a retirement account contributions to certain types of retirement accounts such as 401ks and iras may be taxdeductible or taxdeferred which can help to reduce the overall tax burden on your savingskeep good records make sure you keep good records of your savings and investments including any taxadvantaged accounts this can help you to more easily track and report any taxes owed on your savingsconsult with a financial advisor a financial advisor can help you to create a savings plan that takes into account your specific financial goals and situation and can offer guidance on how to minimize the impact of taxes on your savingsits important to note that the specific tax implications of your savings will depend on the laws in your jurisdiction and the specific circumstances of your financial situation its always a good idea to consult with a tax professional or financial advisor to get personalized advice,1
what is the earth rotating and revolving around relative to  relative to the sun  yeah  relative to us  not at all  physicists found out a long time ago that we do nt really notice our speed unless our speed is changing  that is to say we re accelerating   if you get on a plane you ll feel pressed into the back of the seat for take off  but once the plane has hit cruising speed everything seems the same as on the surface of the earth despite going 1000km  hr  why  because we re also going 1000km  hr right along with it  during takeoff we re sitting still and the plane is speeding up  and so the plane moves forward and collides with our backs  the seat pushes against our backs and drags us along with the plane in acceleration  once we re at constant speed  though  there s no push or pull by the plane  we re just coasting along with it  the only thing the earth does to us that s acceleration is gravity  and we kind of do nt notice it simply because it s always there  but you ll certainly notice being upside down or put into space with 0 g conditions  for the same reason that you do nt notice how fast a plane is going while you re in it  we only feel changes in velocity  that is  acceleration   a constant velocity is nt noticeable at all due to inertia  the only way we would notice velocity is from something like wind passing by  like if you have your windows open on a highway   but that does nt happen on earth because it s all already moving at the same speed  we can only tell that we have a high velocity based on objects moving past  which we have no sense of on earth  earth s revolution around the sun is not noticeable because earth follows an inertial path  this means there is no proper acceleration  earth s rotation around its axis  is  noticeable  just not by the human body  in our rotating frame of reference  the rotation manifests itself as the fictitious centrifugal force that  pulls  us away  thus making us weigh about 03  less on the equator than we do in the poles  this is the same phenomenon you d observe if you were on a merry  go  round and you feel like a force is  pulling  you away  edit  typo ,0
so there are four main categories of practical nuclear energy one can consider for spacecraft using technology that we have in hand today  ie no fusion   nuclear reactors as nuclear thermal rockets  this has been  studied extensively   url2   basically you run a propellant  ie hydrogen  through a hot reactor  it can be made to work  it s just very expensive and it is very heavy  there are a lot of proposed ways to do this  but all basically work in a similar way   nuclear reactors as electricity sources  to power eg ion engines   this too has been studied quite a lot   url0   again  heavy and expensive  but probably not a bad choice though for spacecraft meant to go pretty far in space  this is the sort of thing you d use for an in  space thruster as opposed to a rocket   radioactive decay to power electric sources   rtgs   url1    the are pretty good for providing compact electrical sources  they  are  used extensively for things like the mars rovers or satellites  basically they are radioactive materials that are very hot  and that heat can be converted to electricity  apparently the idea of using these as heat sources in rockets has been studied  but generally they have just been used to power apparatus  or ion engines  of things that have already been launched into space   exploding nuclear bombs and using the force created to propel the ship   also quite studied   url3   downside is you have to make and blow up a lot of atomic bombs to make it work  politically not very feasible  expensive  up  side is that it is one of the few really feasible ways to get big ships to go really fast over long distances  why do nt we do any of these except for rtgs  it s probably not so much that any of the other designs are infeasible  except maybe the exploding atomic bombs one  for political reasons   other than the fact that they are expensive  though all space travel sort of is   it s more likely the case that  nobody is at all interested in building long  range  heavy  duty spacecraft   that is  the space  faring nations built up a space infrastructure around liquid fuel rockets  trying to achieve tasks that are pretty easily achieved through liquid fuel rockets â€” putting up satellites  for example  you do nt need nuclear rockets to put a satellite  or even the space shuttle  in space and you probably do nt get many advantages out of doing so â€” certainly no advantages worth the cost of switching systems for  the place you get the real advantages are if you are talking about craft that is meant to travel really long distances or with really heavy weights  but nobody is doing that  because it would be more expensive than any government is willing to pay for in order to achieve  one big reason we do nt see a fission reactor in space is heat  you need to dissipate a significant amount of heat at all times to make electricity  and heat dissipation is limited in space  all long distance spacecraft are nuclear powered  they run all the electrical systems and more  1  url0 2  url2 more on nuclear powered spacecraft from nasa  url1,0

heavier people do not necessarily have more muscle definition because carrying extra weight does not automatically lead to muscle growth in fact carrying extra weight can actually make it harder to see muscle definition because it is hidden under layers of fat nmuscles grow when they are subjected to physical stress such as when you lift weights or do other exercises that challenge your muscles this physical stress causes tiny tears in the muscle fibers and when the muscles repair these tears they become bigger and stronger nusing ankle weights can help you build muscle because they add extra resistance to your workouts which can help challenge your muscles and encourage muscle growth however it is important to remember that muscle growth also depends on other factors such as your diet sleep and genetics nso in short carrying extra weight does not automatically lead to muscle growth but exercising with weights or other types of physical stress can help you build muscle,1
cats are naturally curious animals and they often like to explore their environment and find cozy enclosed spaces to rest and relax in sitting or nestling in boxes bags or small enclosed spaces can provide a sense of security and comfort for cats its also a way for them to regulate their body temperature and conserve energy imagine that you are cold and you want to warm up you might curl up under a blanket or find a cozy spot to rest cats do the same thing and they especially like small enclosed spaces because they feel warm and safe so the reason that cats feel the need to sit or nestle into things like boxes or bags is because it makes them feel comfortable and secure its just something that comes naturally to them and its a behavior that youll often see in cats of all ages and breeds,1

nsure short selling is a way to make money when the price of a stock or other investment goes down heres how it worksnnimagine that you think the price of a stock called abc is going to go down you can borrow some shares of abc from someone else sell them at the current price and then buy them back later at a lower price if the price does go down you can buy the shares back for less than you sold them for return them to the person you borrowed them from and keep the difference as profitnnfor example lets say you borrow 100 shares of abc from someone and sell them for 50 each for a total of 5000 a few days later the price of abc goes down to 40 per share you buy 100 shares back for 4000 and return them to the person you borrowed them from you have made a profit of 1000 5000  4000 by short selling abcnnshort selling can be risky because if the price of abc goes up instead of down youll have to buy the shares back for more than you sold them for and youll lose moneynni hope this helps let me know if you have any questions,1

have you ever had a song that you just cant get out of your head this is a common experience that happens to many people and its called an earworm an earworm is a song or a piece of music that gets stuck in your head and repeats over and over again sometimes its just a small part of a song like the chorus or a catchy melody that gets stuck in your head other times its the whole song there isnt one specific reason why earworms happen but there are a few theories some experts think that earworms happen when our brains are trying to process and understand something that we heard for example if we hear a new song and we really like it our brains might keep replaying it in our heads to try and understand it better another theory is that earworms happen when were in a situation where we dont have a lot of other stimuli like when were driving or doing a task that doesnt require a lot of thinking in these cases our brains might start to focus on the song or piece of music that we heard recently and it can get stuck in our heads its also possible that earworms happen because certain songs or melodies are more likely to stick in our heads than others for example songs with a catchy chorus or a simple repetitive melody might be more likely to get stuck in our heads than songs with more complex melodies overall earworms are a common and normal part of life and they usually go away on their own after a little while so if you have a song stuck in your head just try to be patient and it will eventually go away,1
i m not quite sure how a moonshot could  miss the moon   at worst they would have done an engine burn that was either too short or too long and could have corrected it with the csm engines  let s go for the worst  case scenero  the moon suddenly disappears when an apollo takes off   entering explain like i m 5 mode here  ok  for an apollo spacecraft to go to the moon  it needs to fire a large engine for about 6 minutes  this engine is actually the third stage of saturn v and is discarded after the spacecraft is on the way to the moon  this engine on the third stage of the saturn v is very powerful  more than 10 times as powerful as the main engine on the apollo service module  if you lit the engine and went towards the moon  that just disappeared  btw   you would have sufficient velocity to escape earth s gravity  but not enough rocket power to get back  what would eventually happen to you  well  you d be stuck in solar orbit  unable to return to earth  this happened to a couple saturn v third stages  most interestingly the one for  apollo 12   url0  which was though to be an asteroid when it was re  discovered a few years back  so if you completely miss the moon by pointing your rocket in the wrong direction  you ll end up in an orbit around the sun  tangentially related  nixon s speech in case apollo 11 had died on the moon  url0 there are other factors that have to be considered  does the rocket have enough momentum to overcome the moon s gravity  if not then you will likely orbit the moon until you crash from not being able to maneuver  land at an alternate site  or loop around and return to earth early  if the rocket overcomes the moon s gravity and shoots on out to space you may be able to use maneuvering thrusters to turn around  but you ll probably have to scrap the mission and return home  and if you overshoot the moon  and ca nt maneuver  then you re fucked ,0
when youre riding a motorcycle your eyes naturally follow where you want to go if you see something that you want to avoid your eyes will naturally focus on it this is called target fixationnnwhen you focus on something your brain sends a signal to your body to move in that direction so if youre looking at something that you dont want to hit your body will naturally steer the motorcycle in that direction even if you dont want tonnto avoid this its important to keep your eyes looking ahead and not fixate on any one thing this will help you stay in control of the motorcycle and avoid accidents,1
a public university is a type of institution of higher education that is funded and supported by the government because it is a public institution it is subject to certain laws and regulations that apply to all public entities one of these regulations may be a ban on smoking on campus the university has the authority to enforce this ban because it is responsible for maintaining a safe and healthy environment for all students faculty and staff this means that it can set rules and regulations for activities that take place on campus such as smoking it is important to note that the university cannot completely ban smoking everywhere as people have the right to smoke in certain designated areas or private spaces however the university can set specific rules about where smoking is allowed and enforce those rules to ensure that the campus is a safe and healthy place for everyone,1
classical music is nt just your typical four chord rock song with a basis beat  there are themes in each song and each song used different techniques like counterpoint and countermelodies and polyrhythms and stuff like that where basically different instruments are playing different melodies and rhythms but in the big picture it all comes together to make beautiful sound  composers of classical music also are geniuses because they have to know how a melody they write on a piano will sound for a cello or a french horn and all these other instruments with different timbers and different keys  they did nt sit around in studios trying ideas out  it was all in  a modern rock band has  what  a vocalist  a guitarist  often the same person   bassist and drummer  maybe a dj  keyboardist and a second guitarist  the absolute biggest maybe throw in some backing vocalists  but some of the more successful rock bands have literally just been three dudes  now  compare that to an orchestra where you can have lead violin  first second and third violin desks  first and second violas  first second  and sometimes third  cellos  double basses  piccolos  first and second flute  oboe  and sometimes second oboe  cor anglais  first second  and sometimes third  clarinet  bass clarinet  bassoon  first and second trumpets  first and second trombones  tuba  piano and harp  and probably about five percussionists moving around between three times as many instruments as the score demands  and i have a nagging feeling like i maybe forgot somebody  not to mention the soloist if the piece is a concerto  possibly a classical guitarist  too  and possibly a pipe organ  oh  and let s not forget that some pieces have both orchestra and choir  so let s throw in bass  tenor  alto and soprano  maybe with contrabass  baritone  contralto and mezzo  soprano between them  sometimes with first and second desks in each section of the choir  too  not to mention that some modern composers are starting to blend in electronic instruments into the ensemble as well  then throw in hundreds of years of technical tradition and artistry  there are whole libraries written about  music theory   url0    harmony   url2    intervals   url1   and more  much of which is impenetrably  soul  crushingly dry and academic  but mastery of which has led to some simply incredible pieces  it s not just  considered  more complex  it is more complex  of course  complexity is not automatically the same thing as quality  there s a lot of shitty classical music out there  just the same as there s a lot of shitty pop music  it s just that  like the shitty pop tunes of yesteryear  nobody plays the shitty classical stuff any more  because it is  western classical music has had hundreds of years to evolve and to grow immensely in its complexity  jazz is less than 100 years old  rock music less than 70  electronic dance music arguably less than 40   electronic tape music   url0  was around earlier  but it was very different from what we re used to   while you can find complexity and genius in every genre of music  classical music has the simple advantage of time  what sets beethoven and mozart apart is that you ve heard of them  whether or not you like their music  it s longevity is undeniable  over several hundred years many generations of people have continued to decide that their music is worth playing and listening to  you can make a case for historical eurocentrism playing a part in the deification of these guys  but if the music was no good you can bet we would nt play it  the best music speaks to something universal in all of us  it is this emotional depth and scope that is perhaps the most unique thing about classical music  many people feel alienated by classical music  primarily because the presentation of western concert music today is far more conservative than the content of the music itself  but if you give classical music a fair shake you ll learn that there is nothing  elite  or exclusive about it ,0
christmas is a national holiday in many countries including the united states because it is a widely celebrated cultural and religious holiday many people who are not christian also celebrate christmas as a way to spend time with family and friends and to exchange gifts the concept of separation of church and state refers to the idea that the government should not favor one religion over another or involve itself in religious matters in the united states the first amendment to the constitution protects the freedom of religion and prohibits the government from establishing a state religion or interfering with the free exercise of religion despite this it is not uncommon for governments to recognize certain holidays that are important to a significant number of people within their country even if those holidays are associated with a particular religion for example in the united states christmas is a national holiday but so are holidays like easter thanksgiving and hanukkah which have religious significance for christians jews and others in short christmas is a national holiday in many countries because it is widely celebrated and has cultural and religious significance for many people the concept of separation of church and state means that the government should not favor one religion over others but it does not prevent the government from recognizing and accommodating the religious beliefs and practices of its citizens,1
it does nt go straight through us  water is used by many of the bodily processes we go through on a daily basis  and in addition the water that we do nt  use  is used to wash out waste and transport waste away  as well as help act as a heat sink inside our bodies  water is useful in many functions and very little passes straight through the body without being used by at least one function  interestingly  we drink the amount of water that we do drink because our kidneys are so inefficient  they can only excrete the waste substances to a maximum concentration  so we need a large amount of water to allow our urine to be excreted by our kidneys  of course there are other reasons why we drink water  it is important to stay hydrated  and a lot of water is lost through exercise and heat  it also takes out other waste with it  we do nt just pee out straight water even if it is clear ,0

plastic is porous  meaning  at the micro level  think zoom in with a microscope   the surface of plastic is actually very bumpy  with many gaps  stuff like tomato gets embedded into these bumps  if you microwave your tupperware  it affects the plastic itself  feel how it is easier to bend when warmed in the microwave    the plastic s porous surface actually expands a little  this makes it even easier for the tomato to embed into the plastic  the tupperware then cools  and shrinks back in  trapping the tomato permanently  tomatoes and tomato sauce has a chemical called lycopene in it  it s a little pigment molecule that seems to just perfectly fit into the porous plastic and stay in there for good  either use glassware with tomatoes and tomato based products  coat the plastic with some type of oil or butter before you put the tomato sauce in or use cheap plastic tupperware you do nt care about  can some also eli5 why my ceramic plates and cutlery are stone dry after being washed in a dish washer appliance  but when i remove tupperware items including the lids it is like being hosed down by a fire engine  edit  thanks for the answers guys  i still feel tupperwear is violating the laws of physics  on first examination  it appears like there is only water droplets  yet the second you pick it up you literally need a full sized man beach towel to dry yourself down again  it does nt make any fucking sense ,0

the answer is quite straightfoward  many of their banks ran out of money due to the effects of the 20072008 credit crunch  to prevent a total collapse of the banking system  their governments bailed out the banks  the only way their governments could afford to do this was by borrowing money  but because both countries had already borrowed lots of money during the boom years  mainly to finance speculative building projects   the international finance markets considered the governments of spain and greece  and portugal and ireland  to be bad credit risks  so only lent them the required money at very high interest rates  with the continuing bad global economy  the governments of spain and portugalgreece were nt able to repay the expensive debts they d run up saving their banks  so they turned to lenders of last resort  such as the international monetary fund and the european central bank  those organisations agreed to lend the money to keep the governments afloat  but only on condition that they made very large cuts to government spending budgets  these cuts have had a twin result  firstly  lots of people who used to work for the government have become unemployed  secondly  there has been a large reduction in the general amount of money available in the economy which has meant many other companies have had to let staff go  the net result is a very big contraction in the economy and an even larger leap in the number of unemployed people  edit  s  portugal  greece in 3rd para the simple answer is that people continue to believe a country can not function in debt  furthermore  they believe countries must get out of debt as quickly as possible by cutting spending  this is called austerity  people also continue to believe that austerity can improve a country s standing by reducing debt  but fail to recognize that in most cases government spending serves an important purpose  when austerity measures are taken  that is money not put into the economy directly lowering gdp  gdp per capita  and thus the welfare of the citizens  job loss should be expected in such circumstances as the government is employing fewer people and businesses will cut jobs to avoid going under  what you see in greece and spain is the result of highly  integrated socialist  welfare state policies  greece in particular spent way more money than they had  as a nation  and has been doing so for a couple hundred years  occasionally defaulting on the money owed to others  what did they spend it on  perks and entitlements for the citizens  in the last decade or so  public sector salaries nearly doubled  people got pensions at  90  of their previous salaries  and let them get this starting at age 58  the government paying people retired people inflated wages for doing nothing for 30 years is a great way to run out of money  when they joined the euro  they thought they were clear to keep spending money like water  but they ran into a problem  they do nt control the euro  we spend too much money here in america also  but we have a way to  fix it   we just print more money  it devalues the currency  but it keeps us from defaulting  greece  as part of the euro  ca nt do that  the european central bank decides when to print more euros and tell the greeks to take a hike  the economy tanks  this alone causes unemployment   edit for expansion  the reason the ecb wo nt print more euroes to keep greece afloat is it would affect all of the euro countries  germany and belgium et al say   hey  there s nothing wrong with our economy  you ca nt screw us to dig yourself out of debt  fix it yourself  ,0
youtube has a   lot   of video content  100 hours of video are uploaded every minute  and a lot of viewers  over 6 billion hours of video are watched each month     stats    url0  youtube handles all this data by prioritising popular videos  notice how the ads always play perfectly and the super popular videos also play without any problems  that s because youtube keeps those videos ready to play while the millions of less popular videos are kept at a lower priority  what this means for you is that these lower priority videos often are nt given enough bandwidth by youtube to play properly or youtube has trouble even finding the files  porn video sites have far less content and far less users  so it s easier for them to handle the traffic and keep files on hand  the one thing i would love to know  youtube is the biggest video site on the inernet  why the fuck can not i not set youtube to always load in 720  it s is a very basic function and it can not do it  i need to resort to extensions and scripts  youtube team need to get their act together  in the past  i have found that sometimes  isp provided dns handles youtube in funny ways  for better results  consider using google s dns as your dns settings  8888 and 8844 url0,0

black holes have finite mass and therefore finite gravity  a theoretical singularity would be infinitely dense not because it has infinite mass but because it has zero size  but that just means that it does nt make sense to describe the density of a singularity  so  forget about black holes for a minute  just think about the sun  the sun has gravity  like everything else that has mass   so if you were in a spaceship in our solar system  the sun s gravity would be pulling on your spaceship  pulling you toward the sun  if you wanted to leave the solar system you d need to fire your engines  and get enough thrust to get up to a certain speed  which would let you escape from the pull of the sun s gravity  how much thrust  that depends on how close you get to the sun  the closer you are  the stronger the sun s gravity pulls on you  so the closer you are to the sun  the more thrust you need from your engines in order to get away  if you get too close  or if your engines are nt powerful enough or you do nt have enough fuel  you might not be able to get away  if you really screwed up  you might even fall into the sun  but as long as you show up with a powerful enough engine  and enough fuel  you can get as close as you can stand  if you also have super heat and radiation shields  you could even go into the sun and maybe all the way down to the center  then come back out  it would require one heck of a ship to do that  but it is at least theoretically possible  now  consider a black hole with  say  4 times the mass of the sun  from way out you would nt notice anything strange at all  you d feel the same pull as if there was just a normal star of that mass  and as you got closer  you d feel a stronger pull  the same as if you got closer to a normal star  but the strange thing about the black hole is that as you come in closer and closer  and the pull gets stronger and stronger  you will eventually come to a point  a point which is  not  the singularity  where you can no longer get away  no matter how powerful your spaceship is  this point is called the  event horizon   and once you cross it  you would only be able to get away if your spaceship was powerful enough to reach a speed faster than light  but that is actually impossible  it would require more energy than exists in the entire universe  so a black hole does nt just suck the entire universe into it  to things that are far enough away  its gravity is nt especially strong  and would feel just like a star of the same mass  and anything moving fast enough to get away from a star of that mass will also get away from the black hole  as long as it starts out from far enough away  it s only things which get too close and cross the event horizon that can never escape  let s say you have two objects  call them a and b  of the same mass  a is a black hole  b is not  let s say you re the same distance r from a and from b  this distance is from one center of mass to the other   if r is large  you feel the same effects from a as you do from b this is newtonian gravity  rather than the gravity of general relativity  only when r is small can you tell the difference between a s gravity and b s gravity  in particular  their gravitational effects are very different if r is less than the schwarzschild radius of a  that is  if you re inside the event horizon  in this case you can not escape from a but could escape from b,0
old age is not a specific disease or condition but rather the accumulation of various changes in the body over time it is a natural process that happens to everyone eventually some people may live longer than others due to genetics lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise and access to healthcare it is also possible for people to die suddenly and unexpectedly at any age due to accidents or other unexpected events even if they are otherwise healthy,1
if a company files for bankruptcy it is typically a sign that it is having financial difficulties and is unable to pay its debts as a result the value of the companys stocks may decline significantly in some cases the stocks may become nearly worthless however it is important to note that not all bankrupt companies necessarily result in the complete loss of shareholder value in some cases a company may be able to reorganize its business and emerge from bankruptcy as a stronger entity potentially leading to an increase in the value of its stocks it is generally a good idea to be cautious when investing in a company that has filed for bankruptcy as there are many uncertainties and risks involved,1
papercuts are painful because they are a type of wound that is caused by a sharp object such as a piece of paper or a blade slicing through the skin when this happens the skin is damaged and tiny blood vessels called capillaries are broken causing a small amount of blood to leak out this can make the area around the cut feel sore and painful papercuts are especially unpleasant because they are often small and hard to see so you might not realize you have one until it starts to hurt they can also be hard to treat because they are so small and shallow which means they can take a long time to heal overall papercuts are painful and unpleasant because they are a type of wound that can be hard to see and treat and they can take a long time to heal,1
cancer is a disease in which abnormal cells in the body grow and divide in an uncontrolled way when cancer cells grow in an organ they can spread beyond that organ to other parts of the body this is called metastasisrnrnif an organ is infected with cancer removing it a procedure called surgery can often help to stop the cancer from spreading however it is not always possible to completely remove all of the cancer cells especially if the cancer has already spread to other parts of the bodyrnrneven if all of the cancer cells in an organ can be removed it is not always possible to replace the infected organ with a donor organ this is because the patients body may reject the new organ just like it can reject a transplanted organ in any other situationrnrnin addition not all types of cancer can be treated with surgery some types of cancer such as leukemia a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow cannot be cured by removing an infected organrnrnin summary while removing an infected organ can sometimes be an effective way to treat cancer it is not a cureall other treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be necessary to help kill any remaining cancer cells and prevent the cancer from coming back,1
because those rides and characters were purchased by universal before disney made deals with marvel  disney did not get the rights to those things when they got marvel  back in the 1990s  long before marvel was acquired by disney  they signed an impressively tight contract with universal for the rights to the characters in use within theme park attractions  the contract limits the use of the characters on the east coast of the country to universal orlando with even tighter restrictions within a 60  mile radius of the orlando parks  the contract does have a few stipulations  like ensuring upkeep of the rides  but overall is definitely more favorable to universal than marvel  since that initial contract  disney has bought marvel  pumped millions of dollars into it and made it one of the most popular brands in modern film history  with billions of dollars in sales annually marvel has proven to be a cash cow for disney  the company  long known for its theme parks tie  ins  has already announced a ride in hong kong along with a small exhibit at disneyland in california  while marvel is slowly but surely being rolled out into the disney parks globally back here in florida  that airtight contract from the 1990s still blocks them from building anything at their most popular resort complex  url0 do they  i ve never been there so i do nt know  but if they do have them then it s likely the same reason fox has x men and sony has spider  man  licensing ,0
automatic investment is a type of investment plan in which a predetermined amount of money is automatically transferred from a bank account or paycheck into a brokerage account or mutual fund on a regular basis typically monthly this type of investment strategy is often used to build wealth over time through dollarcost averaging which involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals regardless of the price of the investmentan automatic investment fee is a charge that is assessed by the brokerage firm or mutual fund company for providing automatic investment services these fees may be assessed on a pertransaction basis or as a percentage of the amount being invested it is important to understand the fees associated with an automatic investment plan and how they may impact your overall returns some brokerage firms and mutual fund companies offer automatic investment plans with no fees so it may be worthwhile to shop around and compare different options to find the best plan for your needs,1
sure i can try to explain these electrical terms in a way that a fiveyearold might understand amps amps are a measure of the flow of electricity in a circuit you can think of them like the amount of water flowing through a pipe the more amps the more electricity is flowing just like the more water in a pipe the more water is flowing volts volts are a measure of the pressure of electricity in a circuit you can think of them like the pressure of water in a pipe the more volts the more pressure there is just like the more pressure in a pipe the more the water will flow ohms ohms are a measure of the resistance to the flow of electricity in a circuit you can think of them like the size of the pipe the bigger the pipe the less resistance there is to the flow of water just like the lower the ohms the less resistance there is to the flow of electricity watts watts are a measure of the amount of energy being used or produced by an electrical device you can think of them like the amount of work being done for example a light bulb uses watts to produce light and heat the more watts the more energy is being used or produced i hope that helps to explain these electrical terms in a way that makes sense to you let me know if you have any more questions,1
water is important for our bodies because it helps to keep us hydrated and supports many of the bodys functions when we are dehydrated we may feel tired or have difficulty concentrating drinking water can help to replenish the water that we lose through activities such as sweating and urination while soda and other beverages may contain water they often also contain other ingredients such as sugar caffeine and artificial flavors these ingredients can have negative effects on the body if consumed in large amounts for example too much sugar can contribute to weight gain and increase the risk of dental cavities caffeine can cause jitters and interfere with sleep it is generally recommended to get most of your water intake from plain water rather than from other sources like soda this is because plain water is a simple pure source of hydration without any added ingredients that could potentially be harmful to your health however it is also important to remember that it is okay to occasionally enjoy soda and other flavored beverages as part of a balanced diet just be sure to limit your intake and drink plenty of water as well,1
let s take a wheel that s spinning fast  but not fast enough that it looks like it does nt look like it s spinning backwards  it s rotating at 45 degrees per frame  the eye processes the motion as going forward  however  when the car wheel s spinning really fast  let s say that it rotates at 355 degrees per frame  when the wheel moves 355 degrees forward  it s the same as moving five degrees backwards  on the next frame  it moves a further 355 degrees forward  which is the same as five degrees backwards  the brain interprets this into  the wheel is rotating five degrees per frame backwards  rather than  the wheel is rotating 355 degrees per frame forward   imagine a clock with only a second hand  it goes round once a minute  but you take a photograph of it every 59 seconds  in the first photo the hand is pointing straight up  in the second photo it s at 59 seconds  in the third photo it s at 58 seconds  and so on  if you play the photos back like a movie it will look like the second hand is moving backwards  on occasion  you can also see this in real life  usually because some clown has put  spinners  on his car rims ,0
going on a roller coaster can be an exciting and thrilling experience but it can also cause some strange sensations in your body when you go down a steep drop or turn quickly your body can feel weightless which can make you feel like youre floating or falling this can also cause your stomach to feel strange or make you feel like you need to go to the bathroom one reason for this sensation might be that the roller coaster is moving so quickly that its hard for your body to keep up this can cause your internal organs to shift around which can create a strange feeling in your bladder or genital area another reason might be that the movement of the roller coaster is making it difficult for your body to maintain its balance when your body is trying to balance itself it might cause you to feel like you need to flex or clench certain muscles this is completely normal and is just your bodys way of trying to stay steady overall the sensations you feel on a roller coaster are completely normal and are just your bodys way of reacting to the excitement and movement of the ride,1
