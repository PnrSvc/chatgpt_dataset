i found this really helpful and a fun way to understand it when i was learning this last year at uni  you can see how many different drugs affect your brain as well as just how weed does  plus the mice are frickin  awesome  while we re on this eli5  why does smoking pot make me anxious  and make me scared  it s like i do nt like the feeling it gives me  and i feel like i may be  stuck  like this forever  however alcohol does nt do this to me  and i quite enjoy getting drunk  what i ve heard from an actual real live doctor is that it affects the novelty detecting part of the brain  it makes everything seem like a  new  thing  since humans are novelty seeking creatures  because evolution  i ca nt give a better answer than that  sorry   we get a little dopamine surge from new things  if everything seems new  thanks to thc  everything seems more interesting and demanding of our attention  there more to it than that but it explains a big part of why stoned people are more fascinated by music  art and food than their sober self ,0
because all you want to see is us making out  and you get pissed when you ca nt join women usually do nt feel that way about gays women with gay friends generally respect their sexual orientation and have no interest in actually dating those friends  because they know their chances are essentially 0   some gay men might like befriending women because they can be fairly certain there is no sexual attraction involved and it s entirely platonic  as opposed to befriending other gay men  where attraction is more likely  in contrast  men are usually considered to have a harder time accepting women who have no interest in dating them or men in general   friendzoning  etc   that is nt to say that all men are like this  or even the majority  but unfortunately they can come across that way as group  and for this reason  many lesbians are nt keen on having lots of guy friends  the effort to  convert  lesbians might stem from some men s perception of lesbianism as something that is less concrete  since many straight girls experiment with other women  actual lesbians can find those efforts offensive and arrogant  i personally have lots of male friends  but i have met guys who hit on me incessantly and disregarded my orientation  i do nt agree with the reasoning that all men are sexually aggressive towards women or only interested in lesbians if they re making out  top two responses at the time i am posting   these are broad statements and untrue for many people  a lot of it is cultural and linked to shared interests  not to stereotype here  but there are many aspects of your traditional gay male subculture that align perfectly with activities typical of women  when we talk about activities such as shopping  fashion  dancing and of course  talking about interest in other men  we think of gay men and women being the predominant participants  shared interests  friendship in many cases  these are also activities that are very female dominated in terms of interest and viewership  as a straight male  i would probably have mostly female friends if i shared interests in activities that had mostly women in them  my sexual orientation is nt a factor here  this analogy does not translate directly to men and lesbians for several reasons  let s talk about sports  the few lesbians i personally know would much rather cheer for a women s sports team instead of the male counterpart  in almost all sports  there is a clear division of gender  when s the last time you heard of a man talking about the latest wnba game  one of my lesbian friends dresses very feminine and is very into fashion  and guess what  most of her friends are women  furthermore  i have noticed that there is  anti  men  trend with some lesbians and with some women in general  this trend is nonexistent with the gay male subculture  on the topic of men being sexually aggressive towards lesbians or not being interested in a woman they can not sleep with  while i stated above that this is a broad  stereotypical statement  there are certainly some men who fall into the category  i think some of this can be tied into how our movies  tv shows  pop culture  etc  tends to portray gay men as friendly  flamboyant  and cheerful  when you talk about lesbians  the first thing most people think of is porn  there is certainly an unequal and unfair portrayal in media and that plays a role in how men and women behave  once again  not trying to stereotype unfairly or pretend that i am an expert on the subject matter  some of the top answers are a bit narrow minded  so i wanted to contribute an answer that examined more potential causes from a variety of sources ,0
supersonic flight or flight at speeds faster than the speed of sound can be a challenging and expensive proposition for several reasons one of the main reasons is that supersonic flight creates a lot of noise which can be disturbing to people living near airports this was one of the main issues with the concorde which was a supersonic passenger plane that was in operation from 1976 to 2003 another reason is that supersonic flight requires a lot of fuel which can be expensive and environmentally harmfulnnthere have been some attempts to develop new supersonic planes in recent years but these efforts have not yet resulted in the widespread adoption of supersonic commercial flights this is partly because of the technological challenges and costs associated with supersonic flight as well as the fact that there is currently strong demand for more environmentally friendly forms of transportation however it is possible that supersonic flight may become more common in the future as technology improves and the demand for faster forms of transportation increases,1
electric motor design engineer here  ac motors are designed in such a way that they convert the back  and  forth of ac current into a rotating magnetic field  this is in general done by using more than one phase that is offset from each other  a good way to imagine this is to think of a 4 way tug of war contest  with the contestants located at north  south  east and west and a flag in the middle  if the just the north and south contestants are pulling back and forth then the flag will moving in a straight line from north to south to north to south  if the just the east and west contestants are pulling back and forth then the flag will moving in a straight line from east to west to east to west  by themselves  they just move in straight lines but if you get all the contestants to pull at the right times you can get the flag in the middle to rotate in a circular motion  ac motors work kind of like that  they have coils of wire wrapped around teeth in the motor that are offset from each other  then the different coils have ac current running through them at different phase angles in relation to each other that helps produce a rotating magnetic field  3 phase motors draw current from the power company that is already spaced 120 degrees apart from each other  single phase motors have to use  tricks  to convert 1 phase into 2 phases that are spaced 90 degrees apart  because of the way ac motors are set up  this was actually an engineering quandry in the 19th century as it was well  known that ac could transmit farther than dc  but there were no motors that would actually work with ac  that s why tesla is so important in not that he popularized ac  but that he created the ac motor  something that could actually use the changing current to do work  the motor works by rotating the magnetic field  here s an animation of it  url0 if the device in question needs dc to function  it will include a converter to take the ac from the wall and convert it to dc   which is actually the opposite of what happens at the power station  where dc from the turbines is converted to ac for the lines  ,0
if you are going to be trying clever stuff with taxes in different place you probably need a professional different countries definitely have different laws on the subject  for example several years ago the uk considered you absent from the uk for tax purposes from the day you left provided you were gone for a year whereas canada didnt charge you tax as long as you were not in the country for six months in the year a carefully timed move enabled me to not pay tax at all for six months because i wasnt resident anywhere also it was irrelevant whether i intended to stay or not,0
there are a number of reasons why some people on reddit and elsewhere may be critical of israel or have antiisrael views here are a few possible explanationsnnthe israelipalestinian conflict the conflict between israel and palestine has a long and complicated history some people may criticize israels actions or policies related to this conflict such as the building of settlements in palestinian territories or the treatment of palestinian citizens in israelnnhuman rights concerns some people may criticize israels treatment of certain groups within its borders such as palestinian citizens or refugees or its policies towards other countries in the middle eastnnreligious or cultural issues some people may have negative views of israel due to their religious or cultural beliefs for example some muslims may view israels actions as being against islamic teachings or as a threat to the palestinian people who are mostly muslimnnits important to note that there are also many people who are supportive of israel and its policies and the views on this issue are often complex and nuanced its also important to remember that reddit is a large and diverse platform and the views expressed on it do not necessarily reflect the views of the wider community,1
water beads up when it comes into contact with a surface that is hydrophobic meaning it does not easily mix with water the water droplets form into a sphere shape because it is the shape that allows the least amount of surface area in contact with the hydrophobic surface on another planet it is possible that the beads of water could be the size of humans if the conditions on that planet were different than on earth for example if the gravity on the planet was much stronger it might cause the water beads to be larger because the force pulling the water down would be greater,1
to investigate the historical effect of rebalancing on return and standard deviation you can follow these stepscollect data on the performance of a portfolio that was rebalanced at regular intervals eg annually quarterly monthly etc and a portfolio that was not rebalanced you may be able to find this data from a financial database or you can create your own by simulating the portfolios performance using historical data on the returns of the assets it holdscalculate the return and standard deviation for each of the portfolios over the same time period you can use standard statistical techniques to do this such as calculating the mean and standard deviation of the returnscompare the return and standard deviation of the rebalanced portfolio to those of the nonrebalanced portfolio this will give you an idea of the effect that rebalancing has had on the portfolios performanceconsider other factors that may have affected the performance of the portfolios such as changes in market conditions or the specific assets that were held in the portfolioit is also a good idea to consider the costs associated with rebalancing such as trading fees and taxes as these can impact the overall performance of the portfolio to investigate the historical effect of rebalancing on return and standard deviation you can follow these stepsgather data collect historical data on the asset prices and returns of the assets you want to include in your portfolio this could be daily weekly or monthly data depending on the frequency of rebalancing you are interested in analyzingcreate a portfolio using the data you have collected create a portfolio that represents the allocation of assets you want to analyzebacktest the portfolio use the historical data to backtest the performance of the portfolio this involves simulating the buy and sell decisions that would have been made at each rebalancing period based on the portfolios target allocation you can use a tool like excel or a financial software package to do thiscalculate returns and standard deviation once you have backtested the portfolio you can calculate the returns and standard deviation of the portfolio over the period you analyzed you can compare these measures to those of a portfolio that was not rebalanced to see the effect of rebalancing on return and riskanalyze the results look at the results of the backtest to see how rebalancing affected the returns and risk of the portfolio you can also try different rebalancing frequencies and portfolio allocations to see how they impact the portfolios performancekeep in mind that the results of a backtest are only an approximation of what might have happened in the past and cannot be used to predict future performance it is always important to consider the limitations of backtesting and to conduct thorough due diligence before making investment decisions,1
using the air conditioning in your car does use a little bit of gas when you turn on the air conditioning the compressor which is a part of the air conditioning system turns on and uses a small amount of power from the engine this power comes from burning gas in the engine so using the air conditioning does use a tiny bit of gas however the effect on your gas mileage is usually not very big the main thing that affects how much gas your car uses is how fast you drive and how heavy your foot is on the gas pedal,1
there are a number of conspiracy theories surrounding the events of september 11 2001 also known as 911 which is the day that terrorists hijacked four commercial airplanes and crashed them into the world trade center in new york city the pentagon in washington dc and a field in pennsylvania many of these conspiracy theories claim that the attacks were not carried out by terrorists but were actually planned and carried out by the united states government or other powerful organizationsnnone of the main arguments made by those who believe in 911 coverup conspiracy theories is that the collapse of the world trade center towers was not caused by the impact of the airplanes and the resulting fires but was actually the result of a controlled demolition however there is no evidence to support this theory and it has been debunked by numerous experts the collapse of the towers was investigated by a number of organizations including the national institute of standards and technology nist which concluded that the towers collapsed due to the combined effects of the impact of the airplanes and the fires that resulted from the crashnnanother common argument made by those who believe in 911 coverup conspiracy theories is that the attacks were not carried out by terrorists but were actually an inside job carried out by the us government or other powerful organizations however there is no credible evidence to support this theory and it has been thoroughly debunked by multiple investigations including the 911 commission report which was conducted by a bipartisan panel of experts and found that the attacks were planned and carried out by a group of terrorists affiliated with alqaedannits important to remember that conspiracy theories are not based on evidence and can often be harmful as they can spread misinformation and cause people to mistrust legitimate sources of information its always important to carefully evaluate the evidence and consider multiple sources before coming to any conclusions about a complex event like 911,1
i saw an article once that suggested this is an evolutionary response  imagine life in prehistoric times  or maybe going as far back as the common ancestor between apes and men  nobody knows which plants are poisonous and which ones are safe to eat  a bunch of us are sitting around eating and someone gets violently ill due to being poisoned  if we re all eating the same plant  it s too late for the guy who got poisoned but it might not be too late for the others  those who get grossed out and throw up stand a better chance of not getting poisoned  evolution selected for the ones who puked  update  if you d like to learn more and maybe answer some of the questions below  google  sympathetic vomiting  and also look at stuff related to the area postrema  which is the part of your brain that triggers vomiting  very interesting stuff  read the storytelling animal  it s take on how humans walk through scenarios in their mind as an evolutionary tool for preparedness may explain this  it s why we tense up or cry during movies  to the brain  and your body s response  looking at something happening can trigger a physical reaction because the story in your mind can be indistinguishable to it actually happening to you  it s a way of doing practice runs for surviving likely future scenarios  and this would be a side effect of this very useful tool  surely it s fairly obvious   disgusted  is a reaction we feel to things that typically harbour dangerous bacteria  fecal matter  rotting carcasses  infected wounds  vomiting is a natural reaction that prevents you ingesting life  threatening material ,0
the federal government sets a minimum wage that applies to all states but states are allowed to set their own minimum wages as well if a state sets its own minimum wage and it is higher than the federal minimum wage then workers in that state are entitled to be paid the higher state minimum wage but if a state sets its own minimum wage and it is lower than the federal minimum wage then workers in that state are still entitled to be paid the federal minimum wage which is higher so for example if you live in alabama and you work a job that pays less than 725 an hour you are still entitled to be paid the federal minimum wage of 725 an hour because that is higher than the state minimum wage of 515,1
the pressure of the air in your lungs is about the same as the pressure in the bottle  since the bottle is rigid and does nt get bigger if you blow into it  any increase in the amount of air in the bottle results in higher air pressure in the bottle  the increased air pressure very quickly gets stronger than the force you can exert with the muscles that push the air out of your lungs and you ca nt exhale any more after that  think about blowing up a balloon  bike tire  or other inflatable object  it s pretty easy to blow or pump air into at first because there s very little air pressure inside  the last few blows or pumps are hard to make though because the air pressure increases as you fill up the object  it s the same thing here  only the bottle is already full of air from the atmosphere  because the bottle is already filled with air at the same pressure as the rest of the room  atmosphere you are standing in  when you try to exhale into the bottle  the existing air in the bottle has no place to go because your mouth is covering the only exit  as you exhale  you re increasing the pressure inside the bottle  and you re feeling this pressure as resistance when you try to exhale  tldr  you re trying to add air to a bottle that is already completely full of air  the bottle has a limited volume and is already filled with air  your lungs are not strong enough to compress the air and force more air into the bottle ,0
the general test is do they normally interbreed in the wild in a way that results in offspring that are health enough to breed in turn  if they do  species  if not 2 species  human can all interbreed  so all the same species  and our genetic diversity is shockingly small compared to most species dues or a fairly recent evolutionary bottleneck  one of the reasons racism is stupid  an average family group of chimps had more generic diversity than all of the human race  animals with slightly different genetic traits are not automatically considered separate species  all different dog breeds have slightly different genetic traits and they are still all dogs  same with cats or horses  humans have slightly different genetic traits across different population  yes  these are not different enough to consider them different species though based on the many different things biologists take into account when determining what population is a different species  which includes things like genetics  morphology  diet  spread  willingness  ability to create offspring etc  species is a fuzzy term  beyond that  the genetic differences within humans are not easily bundled up into race  for instance  when we think of  races  in context of humans  we tend to base these on superficial characteristics  what color is the skin  is probably the major one for many of us  but as an example  within a group of people we d easily consider  black   there can be more variation than there is between a person we consider black and a person we consider white  that is to say  you can easily find people between races that are more genetically similar than you might find  within  a particular race  consider  for instance  that in the us  many people of mixed parentage will be automatically considered black if their skin is visibly a mix of white and black characteristics  yet they share half their dna with a white parent  so really  we do nt have any divisions  in humans  that are particularly striking that would lead us to see different species  beyond that  however  and when you look at nature itself   species  is  well it s kind of broken  a lot of people will say  it s a different species if it can not interbreed successfully  but that s not really accurate  there are animals of the  same  species that can not interbreed  there are animals of the  same  species that can interbreed with some of the rest of their species  but not all of the rest of their species  there are  many  animals of different species that can interbreed  some of which can themselves reproduce  and there is an entire kingdom that does nt have sex in the first place  differences exist on a continum  unless you are a clone  you are a bit different from another of your species  you re a bit more different than our ancestor species from which humans descended  yet at no single point would we say  this is when the first human was born   instead  each offspring was a bit different from its parent  we define separate species as a somewhat arbitrary point along the way of  a little different  that we determine is  different enough   often after the fact  when we see the accumulated differences of millennia ,0
it can be a good idea to get a mortgage when buying a house for credit reasons as long as you are able to make the monthly payments on time and in full a mortgage is a type of loan that is used to finance the purchase of a home when you take out a mortgage you are borrowing money from a lender to pay for the home and you agree to pay the lender back over a period of time usually several yearshaving a mortgage can be good for your credit because it shows that you are able to borrow money responsibly and make regular payments on time this can help to improve your credit score which is a measure of your creditworthiness and is used by lenders to determine your ability to borrow moneyhowever it is important to keep in mind that taking out a mortgage is a significant financial commitment and it is important to carefully consider your financial situation before deciding whether or not to get a mortgage you should be sure that you can afford the monthly mortgage payments and other related expenses such as property taxes and insurance if you are not able to make your mortgage payments on time it could have negative consequences for your credit score and financial standing,1
they have no purpose  we develop the characteristics of women first while in the womb and what makes us male develops afterwards  i once rented a cheap car that just had a blank panel where the tachometer would normally be  that model of car did nt come with one  but it was cheaper for the manufacture to just have a single instrument panel for all their cars  instead of making a special one  evolution works the same way  it is  easier  to have small  mostly harmless nonfunctional organs on one sex than for them to be completely absent  when babies are formed  they all start female  we switch gender only when certain chemicals are introduced  though nipples already are in place  nipples on men are rather useless  but we got used to them so much that a person without them would look weird  also  with a proper set of hormones you could make a man lactate ,0
black friday is the day following thanksgiving day in the united states  often regarded as the beginning of the christmas shopping seasonthis was taken to a new extreme in 2011 when several retailers including target  kohls  macys  best buy  and bealls  opened at midnight for the first timein 2012 walmart and several other retailers announced that they would open most of their stores at 800 pm on thanksgiving day except in states where opening on thanksgiving is prohibited due to blue laws  such as massachusetts where they still opened around midnight prompting calls for a walkout among some workers,0
when you put ice on a wound it helps to reduce swelling by constricting the blood vessels in the affected area when you get hurt your body sends extra blood to the injury to help it heal this can cause the area to become swollen or bruised ice can help to slow down the flow of blood to the injury which can reduce swelling and bruising ice can also help to numb the area which can help to reduce pain when you put ice on a wound it can help to numb the nerve endings in the area which can make it feel less sore its important to use ice on a wound as soon as possible after the injury occurs this can help to reduce swelling and bruising and can also help to speed up the healing process just make sure to wrap the ice in a towel or cloth before applying it to the skin to avoid damaging the skin,1
scars and stretch marks are different from the normal skin cells that are constantly being shed and replaced scars are formed when the skin is injured and the body repairs the damage by creating a scar stretch marks are formed when the skin is stretched rapidly such as during puberty or pregnancyrnrnthe bodys healing process creates scars and stretch marks by producing extra collagen which is a protein that helps to repair and strengthen the skin when the skin is injured the body sends extra blood to the area to help repair the damage this can cause the skin to become red and swollen as the skin starts to heal new collagen is produced to help repair the damaged tissuernrnover time the redness and swelling will go away but the scar or stretch mark may remain this is because the scar or stretch mark is made up of different types of collagen and other proteins that are arranged in a different way than the normal skin cellsrnrnso even though your body is constantly shedding and growing new skin cells the scars and stretch marks remain because they are a different type of tissue that is not replaced in the same way,1
first  let s get some timeline stuff out of the way   36 billion years ago  prokaryotes appear  simple cells   2 bya  eukaryotes appear  complex cells   1 bya  multicellular life appears  600 mya  simple aquatic animals appear  475 mya  plants emerge onto land  360 mya  amphibians emerge onto land  200 mya  mammals  60 mya  primates  20 mya  family  hominidae   2 mya  genus  homo  so while aquatic life did have a few billion years in the pond before any land animals  you re not going to see any of the complexity you re looking for until 1 bya or so or later  even in the oceans  but more to the point  aquatic life did nt really have a head start at all  this is nt a case where life starts off as single cells in the water  then single cells on land appear half a billion years later    when the first amphibious animal became a permanent resident on land  it was exactly  as evolved  as its cousins that stayed in the water    even if the field is level  is there a particular reason sapient life first appeared on land  well  as other replies have pointed out  there are in fact some serious intellects in the ocean  many species in order cetacea  dolphins  whales  porpoises  etc   display sophisticated social groups  to be fair though  this group was formerly land mammals that returned to the oceans 50 mya  perhaps the advanced cognition evolved there  and they took it with them back to the water  other aquatic animals display serious problem  solving abilities too  but not the level of social development that leads to civilization  so what s special about land  well  take a look outside    nearly every terrestrial biome is chock  full of living things  while the ocean is comparatively empty    sure  there s lots of simple stuff like bacteria  krill and other little things  but there simply is nt enough energy and nutrition to support the metabolism of complex beings  the floor has nutrition  and the sun provides energy  but there s too much water between them  on land  both are available pretty much everywhere    there are simply more niches to fill  and you get more diversity as a result    occasionally these things come together in the ocean  too  but tidal zones and coral reefs are much rarer than rainforests  that means less chance for complex life to develop   tldr  aquatic and land animals effectively started at the same time  from there  land promotes more diversity and progressed faster  edit   cetacea  not ceracea  no pitcher plants here  many marine animals display intelligence  dolphins and octopus are two such diverse creatures from the same environment that display high intelligent function  so it could be possible minus the struggles of technological advancement to have a creature as intelligent as us who s to say it has nt  and it depends on your definition of intelligence  using tools  lots of land animals use them as well as some sea creatures  communication skills  we often read of new discoveries in sea creatures ability to communicate  and the deeper we go in the ocean  the more new species with  intelligent  characteristics are found  good question though ,0
wages in china are lower than in the western world  so china attracted a lot of manufacturing business  you can pay someone  5  day in china  or you could pay them  50  day here in the us  the difference makes even the cargo costs to and from china worth it  as china has become more wealthy  we ve seen manufacturing begin to shift more to india  bangladesh  etc  economic  labor is  for the most part  very cheap in china  so cheap that making a product there is far cheaper than making it anywhere else  even after you factor in transportation costs and quality issues  there are also much laxer safety regulations and government incentives to open new factories  it all adds up to a very cheap cost of goods  because they have no restrictions to their wage limits due to the compleate over population of the country   that s what i know it as at least ,0
for most operating systems  deleting files actually does not remove them from the hard drive  when you delete the file  the first character of the file name is replaced with the    character  this hides the file from the directory structure  much like erasing a building on a street map does not remove the building  more advanced removal involves writing a pattern of characters over the  blank   area of the hard drive  even this process is not a full proof method of deletion  because advanced low level recovery can read the slight differences in the layer of magnetic material of the platter  think of it as a cd but magnetic like a tape   the second method is costly and often incomplete but can recover significant amounts of data  the last method is retrieving data from off  site storage  many programs provide cloud based storage  occasionally people will think they have removed a file but there is a remotely stored copy  there s a few ways  1  wiping your hard drive does nt actually wipe the contents  for example  os s operate in a similar fashion to the dewey decimal system  the os stores a table of pointers  that point to where the actual data resides  if you wipe this table  all the data is still there  but it can be freely overwritten at any time  2  if you actually over write the data stored  due to the propeties of magnetism and such  even if you overwrite a location  you can still guess the data that was there because of lingering magnetic fields  none of these other answers seem to quite properly explain deleting data simply  basically though  all computer data is fundamentally a combination of ones and zeroes  patters of these are programs  files  or everything else on a computer  your pc s operating system knows this  and marks out these patterns  giving them space  the thing is  the harddrive is a big place  once it gives them space  it has to remember where that space is  or else it has to search everything to find it again  so  it creates a table  and in that table it records where the start of those patterns are  as well as what they are  and how big they are  eli5 explanation  its not completely accurate  but close enough here   when you delete a file  all most operating systems do by default is delete its entry in the table  for an operating system  if the space is not in the table  it can be written on  as such  deletes are significantly faster than installs  however  until that empty space is assigned to new files  the old ones will remain  and special programs can search for things that look like files and mark them as such  restoring them  expanding on  and shamelessly using  sirbearus s example  the operating system is like the city layout manager  the table that says where everything is  is a lot like a map  and the files are buildings  when a new guy wants to build a building  he goes to the manager  the manager gives him a plot of land  and he builds his building  later on  the building is scheduled for destruction  to save time and money  the city manager simply removes the building from the map  as such  the building still stands  but no map leads to it  survey crews  special programs  can still search the areas of the map marked as empty  and can easily see if buildings are there  and completely intact  to save costs  they will remain that way until the manager decided a new building is to be built in the lot  which could be a very long time after it was freed up  to get around that  you can use special programs  which will bring in wrecking crews and actually destroy buildings  these things go to the file  and overwrite it with new data  permanently destroying at least some of it  coincidences can mean it does not destroy all of it  the down side is  as expected  it takes a long time  sometimes  they will run multiple times to really ensure random chance does not leave too much data intact  which means it could take a very long time  and  again  as other answers pointed out  even if your manager erases the building on the map  there can still be records outside of the managers reach which prove it was there to begin with  servers can easily record your ip address  unique identifier that can usually point directly to your house  as well as when you arrived  what you requested  and lots of other information  so even if you completely destroyed the files  there can still be a breadcrumb trail from your house to the server you were not supposed to connect to  and it can say exactly what data you asked for ,0
siblings are closely related because they share a common parent when closely related individuals have children together there is a higher chance that their children will have physical defects or health problems this is because they are more likely to both carry harmful genetic mutations that can be passed down to their children when two people who are closely related have children together their children are more likely to have birth defects or other health issues because they are more likely to inherit harmful genetic mutations from both parents to have children without a higher risk of physical defects it is generally recommended that individuals are not closely related this means that they should not be siblings and they should not be closely related through their parents or grandparents the more distant the relationship the lower the risk of having children with physical defects however it is still possible for people who are not closely related to have children with health problems or birth defects as all individuals carry some genetic mutations that can potentially be passed down to their children,1
the white vs red is mostly flavor  from what i remember  though that could be wrong  some of it varies by company  and most cigarettes can actually be pretty different in terms of taste  ease of smoking it  how  harsh  it is   etc  menthol cigarettes have a flavoring added  menthol  believe it or not  which makes the smoke taste  cool  and leaves a subtle minty taste on your mouth  some like it  some do nt  light  ultra  light have a more subtle flavor to them  this is not to be confused with  less tobacco  nicotine  harmful stuff   sometimes that happens to be true  sometimes not  the labeling is merely describing the flavor as far less harsh and more subtle than the normal brand   100 s  are extra long  sometimes skinnier  they have to use colors now  but they used to use words like light and ultra light  for marlboro  reds are the strongest  full flavored cigarette  golds are lights and have a slightly longer filter  silvers are the ultra lights and are even more filtered  there are other flavors and blends of tobacco as well  they eliminated the terms light and ultra light because it implies a safer cigarette  people who smoke these lighter cigarettes tend to drag deeper to make up for it  the health risks have nt been shown to be any less with lighter cigarettes   lights  are the same as regulars  just with one or two rows of microperforations around the filter to let more air into your drag   reds  and other colors are called that because of the color of the box  menthols have menthol in them  each manufacturer of cigarettes use different types of tobaccos and additives so each smoke just taste different  i do nt advocate smoking  but you just have to try different kinds to find out what you like ,0

cats are often drawn to boxes and other small enclosed spaces because they offer a sense of security and comfort when a cat is in a small enclosed space they feel safe and protected from potential threats they may also enjoy the sensory experience of being surrounded by the walls of a box as well as the opportunity to scratch and play with the box itselfnnadditionally cats have a natural instinct to hide and hunt and boxes provide a perfect opportunity for them to practice these behaviors by stalking and pouncing on objects inside the box cats can satisfy their natural urges to hunt and playnnso in short cats like boxes because they feel safe and comfortable inside them and because they provide an opportunity for cats to engage in their natural behaviors,1
a ball only follows a parabolic trajectory in the absence of air resistance  a spinning ball deflects airflow around the ball  which creates a force on the ball  this is called the  magnus effect   url0   spin on a ball causes a slight difference in pressure which will create a lift force  its the same principle as the lift on an aeroplane wing  except in the case of a wing the pressure difference is created by different surface lengths on the top and bottom of the wing  say a tennis player hits a ground stroke with top spin  the ball is travelling along its trajectory towards the other side of the court but it is also rotating towards the opposing player and down  because the top surface of the ball is rotating  forward  and the bottom surface is rotating  backward   the top surface is generating more air resistance  creates a high pressure zone compared to the bottom and a force is applied to the ball moving from high to low pressure  that is the force is applied on the ball in a downwards direction because of the high pressure air flow on top of the ball  and the ball drops to the ground faster than it would with no spin or backspin e  the concept is the same in soccer  except the axis of rotation of the ball is perpendicular to the topspin example  and the force generated is also perpendicular kicking the center of a ball and rotate it by going from center to left  right of the ball with the side of your foot  causing the ball to rotate  kick the ball a little beneath the center so it can go up in the air ,0

fish need a certain balance of salt and other minerals in their bodies to survive freshwater fish have evolved to live in water that has a lower concentration of salt while saltwater fish have evolved to live in water that has a higher concentration of salt nwhen a freshwater fish is placed in saltwater the extra salt in the water can cause problems for the fishs body the fishs cells will try to balance out the salt concentration by taking in more water which can cause the fish to swell up at the same time the fishs cells will also try to get rid of the extra salt by releasing more water which can cause the fish to lose too much water and become dehydrated non the other hand when a saltwater fish is placed in freshwater the lack of salt can also cause problems for the fishs body the fishs cells will try to balance out the salt concentration by taking in more salt which can cause the fish to lose too much water and become dehydrated nso while it is possible for some fish to survive in water that is different from what they are used to it can be difficult for them and may cause problems for their bodies thats why its generally best for fish to stay in the type of water that they are adapted to,1
there are several factors you should consider when choosing between a certified public accountant cpa and tax softwarecomplexity of your tax situation if you have a simple tax situation such as just a w2 and a few deductions tax software may be sufficient however if you have a more complex tax situation such as owning a business or having rental property a cpa may be more equipped to handle your needscost tax software is generally less expensive than hiring a cpa but it is important to consider the potential cost of errors or missed deductions if you use tax softwaretime and convenience using tax software may be more convenient and allow you to complete your taxes at your own pace while hiring a cpa may be more timeconsuming but can also provide peace of mind knowing that your taxes are being handled by a professionalexpertise a cpa has completed rigorous education and testing requirements and is held to a high standard of professionalism tax software may not have the same level of expertise and may not be able to provide guidance on complex tax issuespersonal preference ultimately the decision between a cpa and tax software will depend on your personal preferences and needs it may be helpful to consider your past experiences with tax preparation and whether you feel comfortable completing your taxes on your own or would prefer the assistance of a professional,1

what kind of science background do you have  do you have the prerequisites to read that article  anyway  spin is  plain an simple  a property of subatomic particles  just like an electron has mass and charge  it also has spin  it may sound weird  but spin is no more exotic than charge or mass  it s just another property of particles  any given electron  which is one example of a group of particles called fermions  can exist as one of two spins  12 and 12  an electron can not have any other spin  other particles  called bosons  can only have integer spins  0  1  2  etc  fermions and bosons behave very differently because of their spins  fermions with the same spin  for example  two electrons with 12 spin each  do nt like each other  and do nt want to get too close  bosons with the same spin do nt mind each other  that article is just a mathematical formalization of what i ve stated above  do be afraid to try r  askscience also  try wiki  spintronics  for a practical application of electron spin from what i understand  being a junior in undergrad chemistry   electrons  e  have either an up spin or a down spin  magnetic moments concerned with spin direction   meaning that depending on the direction of the e ball  the charge on the electron is focused either up or down leaving a sort of  electron hole  on the other side of the electron  two electrons per orbital per energy level means that each filled level has a balance of opposing e holes and opposing e  charge  eli5 electrons are like an inflatable ball after being hit in the air  electrons in an atom have directional charge depending on which direction they spin  and there are 2 of them spinning in different directions in every orbital of the atom  quantum scientists are now studying how to use this spin to store data in binary code  01 ,0
as people get older their bodies stop producing a pigment called melanin which gives color to our hair skin and eyes melanin is produced by cells called melanocytes which are found in the hair follicle when we are young our bodies produce plenty of melanin which is why our hair is often dark as we age the melanocytes in our hair follicles stop producing as much melanin this causes our hair to turn gray or white its important to note that everyones hair will turn gray or white at a different rate some people start going gray in their 20s while others dont start going gray until they are in their 50s or 60s there are also many different factors that can affect when someones hair turns gray including genetics lifestyle and overall health,1

jerry alan fodor ëˆfoêšdé™r april 22 1935 â€“ november 29 2017 was an american philosopher and the author of many crucial works in the fields of philosophy of mind and cognitive science his writings in these fields laid the groundwork for the modularity of mind and the language of thought hypotheses and he is recognized as having had an enormous influence on virtually every portion of the philosophy of mind literature since 1960 until his death in 2017 he held the position of state of new jersey professor of philosophy emeritus at rutgers universitynfodor was known for his provocative and sometimes polemical style of argumentationcitation needed he argued that mental states such as beliefs and desires are relations between individuals and mental representations he maintained that these representations can only be correctly explained in terms of a language of thought lot in the mind furthermore this language of thought itself is an actually existing thing that is codified in the brain and not just a useful explanatory tool fodor adhered to a species of functionalism maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the representations that make up the language of thoughtnfor fodor significant parts of the mind such as perceptual and linguistic processes are structured in terms of modules or organs which he defines by their causal and functional roles these modules are relatively independent of each other and of the central processing part of the mind which has a more global and less domain specific character fodor suggests that the character of these modules permits the possibility of causal relations with external objects this in turn makes it possible for mental states to have contents that are about things in the world the central processing part on the other hand takes care of the logical relations between the various contents and inputs and outputsu200a73â€“75u200analthough fodor originally rejected the idea that mental states must have a causal externally determined aspect in his later years he devoted much of his writing and study to the philosophy of language because of this problem of the meaning and reference of mental contents his contributions in this area include the socalled asymmetric causal theory of reference and his many arguments against semantic holism fodor strongly opposed reductive accounts of the mind he argued that mental states are multiple realizable and that there is a hierarchy of explanatory levels in science such that the generalizations and laws of a higherlevel theory of psychology or linguistics for example cannot be captured by the lowlevel explanations of the behavior of neurons and synapses he also emerged as a prominent critic of what he characterized as the illgrounded darwinian and neodarwinian theories of natural selection,0
for a below the knee prosthetic  the foot primarily needs to provide cushioning  many feet have an internal structure that  curves towards the toe  but it also has a heel   url1   there may be a foot shape over top of this  the  long hook shaped prosthetics   url0  are primarily for running  they are less stable  it s like always walking on your toes  and they take more energy to move with  most above the knee prosthetic legs have computer control systems to help with stability and stairs  but for running on flat surfaces the hook shaped legs can be used  they are also used for swimming since they are waterproof  the material is a bit springy and actually assists with walking  whereas the older types were essentially like walking on stilts  very clumsy and harder to control  when you walk  you roll from heel to toe  rather than land with a plonk then lurch on  you could replicate this with a really complicated artificial foot with lots of shock  absorbers and springs and joints and things  or you can have a curved rocker formed from a springy material which apparently makes an acceptable compromise  the improvements in lightness  simplicity and cost are apparently worth it  or so i was told by someone who has one ,0
the two things you describe are commercial and editorial  commercial works require a release from the person on the screen  these can be works of fiction  their main goal is to provide entertainment in a fictional manner  editorial works do not require a release and are generally for telling the  facts   like reporting the news  in canada  whether for profit or not  a broadcaster must secure a consent if a person is the primary subject of a photo or video  if a person is merely an accessory to a picture  like a wide shot of a crowd  or is not identifiable  like shoulder down shots of fat people often used in news stories on obesity  consent is not generally required  the reason for this is that in many jurisdictions there are laws that give people rights with regard to the use and distribution of their own images  these laws  sometimes referred to as  moral rights  or  image rights   are similar to and often grouped with intellectual property rights such as copyright  at its core  copyright is a right to make copies of a particular work  you can understand moral rights as a concept that gives you a copyright on your own image  edit  to insert  in canada  news broadcasts report the news  and are supposed to be objective in their reporting  they report a set of facts  who  what  when where  how   and typically do not have to seek permission to report those facts  since proper journalism is an important way to disseminate information to the public  it would be pretty difficult to report the news if all you could say was  a certain movie celebrity  a male  about 35 years old  was arrested for murder   whereas any other type of show is using names for entertainment reasons ,0
sure ill do my best to explain this in a way thats easy to understandnnrecords are flat round discs that are made of a special kind of plastic they have grooves or lines carved into them in a spiral pattern these grooves are what hold the music that we want to listen tonnto play a record we use a device called a record player the record player has a special needle called a stylus that we put on the record the stylus follows the grooves on the record as the record spins aroundnnas the stylus moves along the grooves it vibrates up and down in response to the patterns in the music these vibrations are then picked up by something called a cartridge which is connected to the stylus the cartridge converts the vibrations into tiny electrical signalsnnfinally these electrical signals are sent through wires to a speaker the speaker is a device that can turn these electrical signals back into sound waves which are the sounds that we can hear when the speaker plays the sound waves we can listen to the music that was recorded on the recordnni hope that helps let me know if you have any other questions,1
wait till your 46  i m still working off the 2 beers i had on new years eve  it has to do with metabolism  this is actually on my biochemistry exam tomorrow  alcohol follows this pathway ethanol  the booze  is turned into a chemical called acetaldehyde as a result of an enzyme  eli5 so i m not going to go into it   this new chemical  acetaldehyde is what is called an intermediate and is actually more toxic than the booze itself and what causes the headache  another reaction occurs and converts this to acetate which is pissed out  a couple things about why hangovers exist and why some people have worse hangovers than others and why as angryjawa s tips help  one  some people have a more active enzyme for the second step  called acetaldehyde dehygrogenase  this means that they can filter out the poison faster and usually overnight so they do not have much if any hangover  when you eat  drink water  electrolytes  etc  you are priming your body to carry out this metabolism by either starting it earlier with food or by simply supplying the enzymes with needed energy  some people start out with a higher enzyme activity which is why they do not have hangovers  in terms of why your hangovers are worse when you are older  my guess would be that your overall metabolism is slowed down so as a result this toxic conversion is slowed down meaning acetaldehyde hangs out longer  which again causes the headache   edited for clarity i find my hangovers are bad when several things happen  1  i get plastered  i mean drunk as fuck  usually happens when i drink to much  like most ppl   this also usually gives me a black screen of wtf happened last night  2  i do nt eat anything before bed  if i get drunkkkk i need to hit up some greasy food  if i do this before bed it makes my hangover so much more manageable  3  i do nt drink any fluids before bed  and or i ve been drinking liquor and pop or very sweet beverages all night ,0

there are a few reasons why native american cultures didnt build large empires like some cultures on other continents one reason is that native american cultures were often based on small decentralized groups that lived in harmony with their environment this meant that they didnt need to build large cities or conquer other groups in order to thrive additionally native american cultures were impacted by european colonization which disrupted their way of life and made it difficult for them to maintain their traditional way of life finally the technology and resources available to native american cultures were different from those available to other cultures which may have limited their ability to build large empires,1
in practical terms it shouldnt  market cap changes every day assuming public trading of course or even secondbysecond and focusing on investor sentiment toward your companys stock is not the wisest way to make strategic decisions that being said company execs do need to be mindful of unusual swings in their companys share prices because it can sometimes be an indicator of newsinformation of which theyre unaware  at the same time you cant just disregard your shareholders especially the big institutional players who may have large voting blocks with which to replace you if they feel youre not responsive to events  they are the ones who make strategic decisions based on your companys share price right grin the issue around swings in market cap is more about public perception than reality so it is important for companies to have a good public relations strategy ready to go that can address questionsconcerns in case of some market event  after all consumers who hear that a companys share price has suddenly fallen by say 30 might be more hesitant to do business with that company because theres a perhaps irrational fear the companys not doing well and may not be around much longer investors are by their very nature emotional rather than rational  any kind of news can cause a stampede toward or away from a stock for no reason that an investment professional could ever explain  thats why its impossible to spend any real time focusing on market cap leave that to your pr department to worry about if as a company executive you focus on doing the right things to make your company successful then any questionsconcerns about market cap will resolve themselves good luck,0
there is no evidence to suggest that whey protein or other bodybuilding supplements cause asthma or worsen asthma symptoms however it is possible that some individuals with asthma may have an allergic reaction to certain ingredients found in protein supplements such as milk or soy if you are concerned about the potential effects of protein supplements on your asthma it is important to speak with your doctor or a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimennnit is also worth noting that some protein supplements contain ingredients such as caffeine or other stimulants which can potentially trigger asthma symptoms in some individuals if you have asthma and are sensitive to caffeine or other stimulants it may be best to avoid protein supplements that contain these ingredientsnnin general it is important for individuals with asthma to follow a healthy diet and to avoid triggering factors that can worsen their asthma symptoms this may include avoiding certain foods and drinks such as those that are high in sugar or caffeine and avoiding exposure to irritants such as tobacco smoke if you are looking to increase your protein intake it is generally recommended to get your protein from whole foods such as lean meats poultry fish beans and nuts rather than from supplements,1
it s because it s very very difficult to test most of the claims in evolutionary psychology  this results in many of the theories being made to fit the evidence rather than the evidence pointing to theories  in other words  this often results in  for example  people saying  men are more competitive than women because it gives them an edge in getting more women and producing more children   now  this may be true  hell  i would say i would nt be surprised if this were true  but is it actually scientifically supported  how do we know that this is something selected by by evolution in the stone age and not something much more recent because of memetics  it is very clear that memetics  does  have a large say in how people behave  and memetics change much quicker than genetics  for  an obvious example  the reason why women wear skirts and men are discouraged from wearing skirts is very  very unlikely to be because of genetics but instead of just well  ingrained gender roles going back thousands of years  maybe that s the case with many of evo psych s claims  how do we know that some behavior was genetically selected for hundreds of thousands of years ago  and some behavior was culturally selected for only a few thousand years ago  and this is especially problematic because many of evo psych s claims back up racist  sexist  etcist beliefs  do nt get me wrong  a belief is nt inherently wrong because it s sexist  the truth is the truth  no matter how politically incorrect it is  but it  is  a huge problem when this belief is nt backed up by hard scientific evidence  and this happens  way  too much with evo psych s claims  they often become  unintentionally or not  arguments for sexist and racist beliefs that may not have any basis in reality at all  url0 the issue is  not  that they think our behavior did nt evolve  you d be an  idiot  to think that our brain did nt evolve to be the way it is  the reason why we all fall for the same optical illusions and cognitive biases is evidence that yeah  that is all genetic  but that is nt what evo psych really  is   evo psych is about identifying the reasons  why  our brains are the way they using genetics as a reason  most of the way we think is because of genetics  but also a lot is simply because of culture  and it s hard to separate the two  most people are familiar with the hand  waving  highly speculative  pop  psych version of evolutionary psychology  this stuff ranges from absolute crap to downright harmful trash that justifies the worst behaviors of humanity  i think it s important to stress that the criticism is nt directed at the concept of evolution having some role to play in the development of our psychology and culture  rather it falls on the  claims  made by some working in the field  we simply have too rudimentary an understanding of the mechanics of the human mind and too little evidence from pre  modern  human cultures to be able to draw firm conclusions  compare astrobiology  when someone says  it s feasible that aliens exist on an earth like planet   that s ok  when someone says  i m sure aliens exist on planet x  alarm bells should start ringing until they provide concrete proof  this is the issue with a large chunk of evolutionary psychology  it s trying to walk before it can run  it s not an inherently pointless field as some here suggest  to understand the interplay between our biology  our cultures and ourselves is immensely important  the problem is nt in the field per se  the problem is with individuals within it overreaching and citing unfalsifiable conclusions  which is antithetical to the scientific method  for all that r  askscience would have you believe it s tantamount to genocide  we do  need  people who speculate and ask questions we ca nt really answer  but as soon as you lose that empirical falsifiability  the ability for someone else to test your theory  then it moves from hard science to philosophy and soft and social sciences ,0
aight  so imagine you and your neighbour do nt like each other  you re not actively fighting  but you d prefer if he went away  the reason you are nt fighting is that both of you can destroy the others house with a press of a button  but pressing that button you know your neighbour will also press his button  and then you both will lose your house  suddenly  your neighbour puts down a machine that prevents your button from working  now your neighbour can destroy your house without you being able to threaten him with anything there is nothing preventing the anti  missile system from targeting chinese missiles if they wanted them to  nobody is suggesting that china wants to use their missiles on anyone  however it does give them some problems at the negotiating table when they know they can not effectively escalate a potential conflict as far as their opponents  when negotiating both parties will think a lot of steps forward to find out who is in the better position  this is similar to a game of chess  there is a set of actions that may lead to missiles being fired at each other  and if the us have an anti  missile system in place but china does not then the us will win in that position  naturally nobody want this scenario to happen but the chinese can not be as confident as the us if it may head in this direction  as an example the conflict about the territory in the south china sea  if the us comes with an ultimatum that china refuses and then start sending survey ships to the area  then china might come and chase them away  if they refuse then sailing their ships close to the aft of a survey ship will cut the streamers and render the ship useless  the us navy will have to respond to this and defend the survey ships  either physically blocking them or fire warning shots  if the chinese navy responds to this threat the us navy might send in a carrier group to defend their ships  at this point china would wish they could send a missile at the carrier but that would not help if they had to face an anti  missile system  as far as i know  the system actually covers parts of the chinese mainland  it s pretty provocative to use any kind of weapon system   defensive or offensive   that reaches foreign territory  the only exception are allied countries   eu  nato  etc   and when the countries are nt really opposing each others and just let each others be  usually  though  it s considered a provocation  because you could attack them at any time without giving them the chance to prepare for it  so they re in a constant state of alert because they can never know ,0
in the olden days people used a combination of methods to draw maps of the world some of these methods included exploring and traveling people would explore and travel to different parts of the world and use their observations and measurements to draw maps they would use instruments such as compasses sextants and rulers to measure distances and angles and make notes about the features they saw such as mountains rivers and cities using written records people would also use written records and descriptions from other travelers and explorers to help draw maps for example they might use information from ships logs or from written accounts of voyages and expeditions using mathematics and geometry people would also use mathematical and geometric principles to help draw maps for example they might use trigonometry a branch of mathematics that deals with triangles to calculate the size and shape of the earth or to measure distances and angles between different points on the earths surface making educated guesses sometimes people would have to make educated guesses about certain parts of the world that they hadnt explored or seen firsthand they might use their knowledge of geography geology and other subjects to make informed guesses about what certain areas might look like overall it took a lot of effort and skill to draw accurate maps of the world in the olden days it required a combination of exploration observation measurement and mathematical and geometric principles,1
guys  guys  guys  it s not just brain size  you re forgetting the whole  bipedal  thing  humans walk on two legs instead of four  this means that the bone structure of our hips is vastly different than most other animals  one side effect of this  is that the birth canal is much narrower for us than for other animals  and it also puts constraints on the size  position of the uterus  as a result of these constraints  a human fetus is born when it is smaller than would be expected for closely  related animals of our size  other animals  like horses  cows  elephants  get to gestate until they re nearly developed enough to walk  a human fetus is pushed out literally as soon as it can breathe  the hormone that initiates labor originates in the fetus  lungs   there is a recent parenting trend of saying a newborn child is in the  fourth trimesterthis perspective has some biological foundation  in theory  humans could probably have evolved to be more self  sufficent  ie ambulatory  at birth despite being smaller  for example  giant pandas are stupid tiny when born  4ozthe size of a stick of butter   and they re crawling around in 2  3 months  although they nurse for 18 months  our evolutionary path developed social structures  rather than physical changes to newborns  to ensure the survival of such small infants  just because they can walk and sniff does nt make them self reliant at all  a puppy  kitten or calf thrown into the wild after a few weeks is still hopeless  then if you account for their lifespan compared to that of humans  they go through a similar length period of learning  edit  seriously  downvotes  i grew up on a farm with cats  cows and horses  and just because they can walk does not mean they are able to survive in the wild at all  the question is about  survival   not brain development into an adult  if you can argument reasoning against my points  do feel free  some of the reason is the size of our brain  we are born much less developed than other animals  because otherwise our brain would be too big to fit though the cervix  i m do nt an educational background in this  so maybe someone more qualified can fill in the details ,0
sure so when people want to use cocaine they usually snort it through their nose or they might inject it but when people want to use crack they smoke it smoking something makes it enter the bloodstream faster and gives a faster more intense high to turn cocaine into crack you need to mix it with water and baking soda and then cook it this process turns the cocaine into a solid form that is easier to smoke the problem is that when you cook cocaine some of it gets lost in the process so if a drug dealer starts with 1 gram of cocaine and turns it into crack they might only end up with 08 grams of crack that means theyve lost 02 grams of cocaine which they could have sold instead even though the drug dealer is losing some of the cocaine they can still make more money by selling the crack because it is easier to sell smaller amounts of it at a time and they can charge more money for it crack is usually cheaper than cocaine but people will pay more for it because it is stronger and they can get addicted to it more easily so even though the drug dealer is losing some of the cocaine in the process of making the crack they can still make more money by selling the crack because they can sell it in smaller amounts and charge more for it does that make sense,1
some history but mostly florida  the history part is that back in the 1950s and 1960s  cuba was a communist state heavily influenced by the soviet union  this was a huge problem for the us  especially when the ussr wanted to put nuclear missiles on the island  this was in the days before the ussr had missiles that could hit the us from soviet territory  so this was a big deal  a whole generation of people grew up remembering the cuban missile crisis of 1962 and how close we almost came to nuclear war  those are the older people in congress right now  the florida part is more why cuba is still hated today imo  when castro came to power  he did a lot of bad things and took a lot of property from a lot of cubans  many of those people fled to the us and settled in florida  because they basically had everything taken from them they are very  very anti  castro  they are also a significant voting block in florida  and florida is a key swing state especially in presidential elections  al gore lost the 2000 election by only 537 votes in florida   votes in florida are important to major elections  so the anti  castro cuban  americans in florida have a significant amount of sway in us  cuba policy  the long and short of it would be because of fidel and raãºl castro  before the castros  there was trade and travel between the two nations  then cuba had a revolution  bringing the castros to power  when the castros came to power  they implemented numerous policies that negatively affected us businesses  this resulted in relations deteriorating very quickly  and so cuba started to do more business with the ussr to compensate for the loss of business with the us  the ussr saw cuba as a strategic opportunity should the cold war escalate into direct armed conflict  the us cried foul  should the soviets attack from cuba  they could hit major us targets so quickly that the us would not be able to react  that pretty much killed all relations between the us and cuba for a while  between 1962 and 1980  relations slowly became better with some mishaps along the way  enter  reagan  he instituted policies effectively tightening up trade and travel to the point of non  existence  then  the cold war ended  so why is there still limited  to  no trade and travel  today  the main reason for failed economic relations is largely because of cuban immigrants who have fled cuba  they have a huge impact over the politics in florida  and florida is a state with enough leverage to affect national policy  the reason cuban immigrants demand such policies is to try and convince the castros  formerly fidel  now raãºl  in changing cuban policy  in particular  increased human rights as well as democratization  tldr  there have been several reasons over time   first  communism negatively affecting us business   second  cuba as a strategic ally of ussr    things get better for a bit    third  reagan   fourth  cuba s human rights record  there is a constituency of cuban immigrants  mostly in florida  who have a bit of power and hate the government of cuba ,0
so in your basic nuclear power plant you have a reactor core  which is where the nuclear material is  this material is radioactive  it s controlled so that it reacts very slowly  but enough to generate heat  the heat generated by the reactor heats water and creates steam  this steam spins turbines which generate electricity  the benefit of nuclear power is that you get an incredibly enormous amount of power for the amount of fuel you have  many  many times more than how much power you get from something like coal or oil  it also does nt create any of the smoke or emissions that things like coal or oil create  those giant towers you see in pictures of nuclear plants are actually cooling towers  part of regulating temperature   basically  you get a ton of energy for a small amount of fuel  and with little impact on the environment around you  it s wonderfully  green  power  the downside is what to do with the fuel once it s no longer usable for the power plant  it s still radioactive  so it s still dangerous  and it needs to be disposed of in a safe way  there is also the risk of a potential meltdown  which is what happens when you lose control of that controlled reaction  and the heat gets so intense that it starts to melt everything   other people are bound to bring up the actual statistics when it comes to the real danger regarding meltdowns  but the fact that there is the potential for an accident scares people  alright i will give this one a shot  how it works is actually  very simple   url0   nuclear energy is created when you create a reaction from uranium and some water to create steam in a nut shell  this steam is funneled through tubes and eventually turns the blades on a turbine that powers a generator that then goes to a transformer and then to the power lines  some of the benefits include   it is very environmentally friendly compared to coal  one gram of uranium yields about the same energy as a ton of coal or oil   it makes a lot of economic sense while it is very costly to get a nuclear power plant up and running once it is running it is much more efficient than most other sources of power  drawbacks   the byproduct of the uranium fissure process used to create steam is plutonium  which is used in nuclear weapons and a large portion of all the plutonium used in nuclear weapons comes from the waste of nuclear energy facilities   there is no real safe way to store the waste  the average dangerous waste a nuclear plant creates is about 20 tons annually  the only way they have thought to remedy this is to bury it deep underground  but once buried they still take about 25 thousand years to eventually decay   its harm on the environment  while the actual process of making the energy is fairly clean the after math of it and the process of getting the uranium in the first place is far from it  mining for uranium is just as harmful for the environment as mining for coal or drilling for oil would be   natural disasters can cause a total meltdown of the fissure process and cause the entire area around the nuclear plant to be contaminated with radiation  splitting the atom creates heat which causes water to boil  the steam from this reaction turns turbines which spin and create electric  basic explanation,0
that does nt really matter much  if there are regulated stores  they will be raided by the dea  but the dea will not be around arresting people who are holding it or more importantly  people who are simply growing some in their own home  it will be impossible to repress casual use  as it is now  but with the difference that state and local police will not arrest upstanding citizens just because they smoke a plant   considering it is technically unconstitutional  right  well  no  it s not unconstitutional  it s illegal on the federal level  but the feds are nt allowed to  police  the states  so they are nt stopping cars going through stop signs and throwing a person in jail because of some pot  that s the primary thing  the feds still have the right to enforce their laws though  so the dea will put a stop to commercial production or stores i m sure  given this showed up in more than one state it s possible it will go to court ,0
every space engine works by throwing stuff out the back  rockets throw the burnt stuff out the back  ion thrusters throw xenon or other gases out the back  but they all throw something out the back  the em drive does nt throw stuff out the back  but it can still make the space craft go forwards  even though it only goes forward a little bit  so it s either a small experimental error  or most of physics is wrong  if the em drive works  then a lot of people are going to have to rework physics  if they are nt to busy building a probe that goes to alpha centuri or something else amazing  it is nt nasa s  it probably does nt work  and it is controversial because it would break the laws of physics if it did work   it is nt nasa s   nasa put together a team to investigate fringe technologies  and this is nt exactly their a team  we are talking three guys in a basement  there were able to quickly dismiss just about everything they investigated  they have nt come anywhere near showing the emdrive works  they just have nt been able to dismiss it out of hand  yet    it probably does nt work   there are tests that show it produces a tiny  tiny amount of thrust  well within the margin of error of the experiment  this is very common in science  a basic experiment shows a minute effect that it can not explained  and more refined experiments are needed to suss it out  to put in in perspective  it is kind of like finding a die that rolls 6 001  more often than it should  because you do nt yet know exactly why this is  you conclude that telekinesis is real    it is controversial   it is controversial because it follows the pattern of every other crank device out there  use preliminary experiment to show insignificant results within margin of error  claim  scientists baffled   and start asking for money  when criticized  claim the conservative scientific establishment is jealous of your unconventional ideas  and that big space is trying to shut you done  bonus if you can mention nasa as every third word in your press releases  it all comes down to this  which is more likely to be wrong  a preliminary experiment conducted in nasa s laundry room  or fundamental  thoroughly tested scientific principles that have stood the test of time  i m not an expert so this may not be entirely true  but since no one else has answered yet ill give it a shot  the problem is it should nt work  in order for something to move one direction  it has to push something the other way  this conservation of momentum  the em drive does nt do this  it does nt push anything  so either it does nt actually work or our current understanding of mechanics is fundamentlly flawed ,0
summarising the  wiki article   url0   it s a policy that married couples can only have a single child  it restricts only those in urban areas who are nt an ethnic minority and are nt an only child  it is still in place  though they have become more lenient in recent years  several provinces will allow anyone to have a second child   it is enforced through fines on those that breach it  having that extra child can also result in a loss of benefits  there are local government groups who focus on enforcing the policy and educating the populace about it  should nt china start relaxing the policy or else they might face a demographic where there will be a lot of ageing population  and the young ones have to work their butts off  what about twins  if the first child ends up being a 2  for1 special  are the parents still fined  lose benefits ,0
we did nt get kicked out  russia is nt letting us use their rockets anymore  there s a big difference  the russians are nt kicking anyone out of the iss  one minister  who is powerful in their space program  but still is just one guy talking and not putin  says that after 2020 the russians are going to end their cooperation with nasa  the esa and jaxa on iss operations  the russians built their modules on the iss to be removable  they have their own power generation systems  their own air scrubbers  and their own engines  technically  the russians could close up the hatches  spin the bolts  and disconnect their stuff from the iss  fly it off to some other orbit  and operate it by themselves  practically speaking nasa is not going to let the iss become inoperative due to the russians doing that  assuming they actually did do it  nasa  the esa and jaxa will kitbash something together to replace the missing russian components and get it installed before a catastrophe happens  right now the only two countries that launch crewed space vehicles are russia and china  nasa has signed agreements with russia for seats on its ships for the next several years  russia has not indicated it intends to unilaterally void those agreements  and frankly  they need the money  so they re unlikely to do so  but even in a worst case scenario  nasa is not going to be without options  spacex pre  announced that on may 28 they are going to disclose the work they ve been doing to upgrade the dragon system to support crewed missions  my suspicion is that they re going to tell nasa they could fly immediately if nasa would accept a higher degree of risk than the current commercial crew specification allows  because spacex s emergency abort system has not been tested   nasa already knows what spacex is going to announce  and russia probably does too  so this may be an empty threat  it s a lot of political theater  not a lot of actual policies  well  we currently do nt have a space shuttle program  wikipedia  url0 iss crew and cargo resupply the iss is planned to be funded until at least 202037  there has been discussion to extend it to 2028 and possibly beyond that38  until another us manned spacecraft is ready  crews will travel to and from the international space station exclusively aboard the russian soyuz spacecraft39  so we are dependent on rides to the iss from the russians  additionally  because the russians are the only ones who can really access the space station  it would be a trivial matter to keep out any unwanted visitors  assuming someone is on board ,0
i would never use a market order  some brokerages have an approval process your shortsale goes through before going to market  this can take some time  so the market prices may well be quite different later some brokerages use a separate account for short sales so you must get their approval for the account before you can do the trade   i like the listing of shares available for shorting the interactive brokers has but i have experienced orders simply going into deadair and sitting there on the screen not being rejected not going to market not doing anything  even though the shares are on the list,0
it is important to consult with a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment of allergic asthma and any related conditions bronchitis is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes which can be caused by infections or irritants and it can lead to symptoms such as coughing shortness of breath and chest pain bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy refers to swelling of the lymph nodes in the chest which can be caused by various conditions including infections inflammation or cancernntreatment for allergic asthma and bronchitis may include medications such as inhaled corticosteroids to reduce inflammation in the airways bronchodilators to help open up the airways and leukotriene inhibitors to prevent inflammation your healthcare provider may also recommend lifestyle changes such as avoiding triggers that can worsen asthma symptoms getting vaccinated to prevent respiratory infections and practicing good respiratory hygiene such as covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneezennin some cases additional tests or procedures may be needed to determine the cause of the bronchitis and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and to guide treatment it is important to follow your healthcare providers instructions and to keep all of your appointments for followup carenni would recommend discussing your concerns and treatment options with your healthcare provider they will be able to provide more specific recommendations based on your sisters specific situation if you have any additional questions or concerns dont hesitate to ask your healthcare provider for more information,1

example   go to the shop  get two bottles of milk  and if they have bread  get six   that statement means the program will by 6 bottles of milk if the shop has any bread because it will do exactly what you tell it to  machines always work according to the laws of physics  the error and even the idea that something is  wrong  is always human  if you imagine a computer program is a recipe  then a bug is like the author of the recipe making a mistake or oversight  say someone who lives in los angeles makes a delicious brownie recipe and sends it to his friend in denver  the friend follows the recipe exactly  but the brownies do nt come out right  turns out that since water boils at a different temperature in denver  the author should have included a special instruction for high altitudes  essentially  in the code there is some mistake like that  since computers always follow instuctions exactly  without thinking about it  the computers are making the mistake and the result is a bug  the more complex the software  the more chance there will be mistakes and bugs  remember when you first started adding two digit numbers  did you ever forget to carry a digit  that s a bug  a bug is what we call any mistake in a program  supposedly  this is because the first error on the first computer was caused by a moth flying into a vacuum tube  bugs can be seen by the user  or they can be fixed silently by the program  but  program can only fix a bug silently if the programmer tells it to expect that error  trying to fix every bug this way is not practical  and in some cases it is not possible  a crash is usually just a specific kind of bug  crashes happen when the mistake is so bad that the program ca nt recover  several programming languages also crash by default if an error occurs that a programmer has not planned for  while most users do nt like crashes  a crash can stop an error from making your computer worse ,0
sure a silencer also known as a suppressor is a device that is attached to the barrel of a gun its purpose is to reduce the amount of noise and flash that is produced when the gun is fired when a gun is fired the bullet travels down the barrel and is propelled out of the gun by a small explosion that occurs in the chamber this explosion creates a loud noise and a bright flash of light a silencer works by using a series of baffles and other devices to slow down and cool the hot gases that are produced by the explosion this helps to reduce the noise and flash that is produced when the gun is fired silencers do not completely eliminate the noise and flash from a gun but they can make a significant difference the amount of noise reduction will depend on the type of gun the caliber of the bullet and the design of the silencer in general a silencer can reduce the noise of a gun by 2040 decibels which is a significant reduction i hope this helps to explain how silencers work let me know if you have any other questions,1
the decline of science and learning in the middle east is a complex issue that has many contributing factors one of the main reasons is that the region has gone through a lot of political and social upheaval over the past few centuries which has disrupted the continuity of education and research in addition some governments in the middle east have not prioritized investing in education and research which has made it difficult for scientists and scholars to do their work another factor is that the middle east has been influenced by various foreign powers over the years and these powers have sometimes imposed their own cultural and educational values on the region this has caused some people in the middle east to lose their own cultural traditions and ways of learning finally the middle east has also been affected by wars and conflicts which have disrupted the education system and made it difficult for people to study and pursue careers in science and other fields so in short the decline of science and learning in the middle east has been caused by a combination of political instability lack of investment in education cultural influences and conflicts,1
they already do to an extent  most honors and ap classes will have students from a couple different grade levels  however  the reason that this is nt done all the time is because school is nt purely for academic learning  it is also important to learn social skills too  for school age children  there is lots of growth between each year  it would be harmful for a 14 year old to spend the entire day around 12 year olds just because he is nt good at schoolwork  a lot of countries outside of the united states do this  for example in germany all students are kept together until the 4th grade  following the fourth grade  students are divided into three different schools  the  lowest  being the hauptschule which focuses on apprenticeship and a slower learning environment  then there is the realschule  which is the  middle  learning school  this school often leads to vocational training  students at the top of the realschule are sometimes able to join the gymnasium after graduation which is the  top  level  students in gymnasium are somewhat focused on a specific track such as language or science and graduate with an abitur and most will go on to the university to study  studies in psychology an education have shown that keeping students with varying abilities is actually better for both high and low ability students for various reasons  also  school is nt just about academics  it s about learning social and life skills  these are better learned with other same  age peers ,0
npower plants generate electricity by using heat to produce steam which drives a turbine that generates electricity the steam is produced by heating water in a boiler which is fueled by coal natural gas or some other fuelnnafter the steam has been used to generate electricity it needs to be cooled down before it can be used again this is where the cooling tower comes in the cooling tower is a large open structure that uses evaporation to cool the steam water from the cooling tower is sprayed into the air and as it falls back down it absorbs heat from the steam cooling it downnnthe condenser is a device that is used to turn the steam back into water it does this by using a system of tubes and a cooling agent such as water to cool the steam down until it condenses back into a liquid this process is important because it allows the steam to be used over and over again instead of just being released into the atmospherennoverall the cooling tower and the condenser are both important parts of a power plant because they help to conserve energy by allowing the steam to be used multiple times,1

the first step i would do is determine the asset class mixture for your current portfolio and the mixture for your new one if they are the same and all you are doing is changing the funds that you use to invest in that mixture of asset class then just do the change all at once in this case there is no market risk as you are just swapping funds hopefully to ones that you feel will better track the underlying asset classes  if you are also changing your asset class mixture then it depends on how large the change is i would still do the whole change at once but if you are worried about fluctuations then you could slowly rebalance into your final position by taking a couple of intermediary steps i would still change all of the fund first but maybe in a mix closer to your current asset mix and then over the next couple of months adjust the ratios to reach your final desired asset mix,0
they did nt  the ad  bc year labeling was developed in 525 ad  with 1 ad being the traditionally dated first year of the life of jesus of nazareth  what amarkov said  also  it s not like people were nt keeping time before that  or that they were nt keeping time elsewhere using different schemes  in the 6th century  a monk named dionysius exiguus was computing the dates of easter for a calendar  at the time  years were reckoned from the reign of the roman emperor who was nt particularly nice to christians  dionysius did nt think that appropriate for his calendar  so he took a wild  not terribly well informed guess as to when he thought christ was born  and based his calendar on that  the calendar became popular  the dating system caught on  and now the world bases their calendars on one man s wild guess ,0
humans are not like lobsters  adding acetylene to your gas tank may boost your fuel efficiency a bit  but that does nt mean pouring it on top of your microwave is a good idea  as a biologist  no  lobsters do not live forever  if you do nt believe me get a fish tank and raise a lobster there and see how long it lives  the article says   which means they would essentially live forever if it were nt for being caught and eaten  or dying from injury or disease  and that is the case with any living organism  the more you get old the more you become prone to diseases and that s why everybody dies  this article is full of scientific inaccuracy and oversimplification  if it was only one gene responsible for this we would have easily been able to inject it in every living organism in the world  some other reply here mentioned this   the genes between humans and lobsters are substantially different  you ca nt just take bits from one and expect the same results in the other  the first part of this is wrong  the second part is right  simply put  a  gene  is just a code the tells the cell how to manufacture a certain protein  nothing else  so we actually have been able to transfer genes between humans  mice  cows  flies  plants  bacteria and even algae  for example  by inserting a gene for a florescent protein called gfp  green florescent protein   obtained from sea algae  into mice  we were able to produce florescent mice  see for example  url0 so  in principle  we can insert lobster genes into humans  now  the second part of the statement is true  you ca nt expect similar results by just inserting 1 gene  genes produce proteins that work in the context of other proteins in the cell or the body to produce results  you ca nt take a computer processor and attach it to a vacuum cleaner and expect to be able to play games on it this way  genes for extremely complex systems in order to produce even the simplest functions  now  to insert a gene into an organism requires you to inject this gene into the organism when it is in the stage of a zygote  which means when the sperm and the ovum fuse and before they divide  to be sure that the gene reaches all the cells eventually   actually things are more complicated than this but lets just keep it to the eli5 level  this experiment may work or may not work  so we ca nt try it on humans because if the experiment fails  you may get a diseased or disabled human  which is obviously bad for him  so do nt expect any kind of similar experiment done on humans in the near future  may be not in the next 100 years until we can 100  sure that this can be done safely in humans  unless of course we get a mad scientist that experiments on prisoners like what happened during the nazi time  which will also probably take a very long time to do  note that you would want to know the effect of such gene on a large enough number of  experimental humans  over their complete life span to be able to judge the efficacy of a certain gene  and when 1 human lives up to 80  85 years old  you can do the math  the genes between humans and lobsters are substantially different  you ca nt just take bits from one and expect the same results in the other  furthermore  gene therapy is in its infancy and only now starting to see any kind of clinical success  that being said  there are undoubtedly scientists that are looking into the use of gene therapy to hinder aging ,0
dinosaurs didnt evolve to be as smart as humans because evolution doesnt work that way evolution is a process that takes place over many many generations and it is driven by natural selection natural selection is the process by which certain traits that help an organism survive and reproduce are passed down to its offspring nfor example lets say there is a group of dinosaurs that live in a forest some of these dinosaurs have long necks which helps them reach high branches and find food these dinosaurs are more likely to survive and reproduce so over time more and more dinosaurs in the population will have long necks this is an example of how natural selection can lead to the evolution of a particular trait nhowever natural selection doesnt always lead to the evolution of bigger brains or greater intelligence in fact many times smaller brains are more advantageous for survival for example small brains require less energy to maintain which means that the animal can use its energy for other things like finding food or avoiding predators nso to answer your question dinosaurs didnt evolve to be as smart as humans because natural selection didnt favor the evolution of larger brains or greater intelligence in dinosaurs,1
nsure stocks and bonds are both types of investments that people can use to save and grow their money heres how theyre differentnnstocks when you buy a stock youre basically buying a small piece of ownership in a company if the company does well the value of the stock might go up and you can sell it for a profit but if the company doesnt do well the value of the stock might go down and you could lose moneynnbonds when you buy a bond youre lending money to a company or government in return they agree to pay you back the money you lent plus interest at a later date bonds are usually considered to be less risky than stocks because they typically pay a fixed amount of interest but they also usually dont have the potential to make as much money as stocksnnso to sum it up stocks are ownership in a company while bonds are loans to a company or government stocks can be riskier but they also have the potential to make more money bonds are generally less risky but they also usually dont make as much money,1
at the boiling point all of a liquid will convert to a vapor  but at any temperature where something is liquid some portion of it will become vapor  for a closed environment this eventually reaches equilibrium  in the case of a puddle the vapor continually blows away from the surface until the puddle is completely evaporated  altus  answer is correct  i ll say it a different way  we say that a liquid is at 100c if  on average  all its molecules have a certain amount of energy of motion  if we give them more energy  they go into vapor phase  eventually   but all molecules wo nt have the same amount of energy  some will have more  some less  this is true of liquids well below 100c  some molecules will have more energy  some less  the ones with more energy  if they are at the surface of the liquid  have a chance of going into vapor and escaping  of course  if the liquid is very cool  then the average energy of each molecule is lower so the chances of one having enough energy to escape goes way down  but it is far from zero  we call this process evaporation  not only does it cause the volume of liquid to decrease  because some molecules are leaving   but it reduces the average temperature of the liquid  the hottest molecules keep leaving  when the  hottest  molecules leave  the molecules left behind have a lower average energy  evaporation happens only at the surface of a liquid and occurs at any temperature  so long as the substance is a liquid at that temperature   however  as most people are aware  liquids evaporates faster at a higher temperature  boiling  on the other hand  happens throughout the bulk of a liquid  usually starting from some site on the inside of the container and rising in a bubble to the surface  it only happens when the temperature is above the boiling point of that substance  per  url0,0
scars are a natural part of the healing process when your skin is injured when your skin is cut or damaged your body works to repair the wound by making new skin cells as the skin heals a scar may form scars are different from the surrounding skin because they dont have the same amount of collagen which is a protein that helps give skin its strength and elasticity this is why scars are often flatter and smoother than the skin around them nsometimes scars can be itchy or painful this is because the scar tissue is still healing and your body is trying to adjust to the new tissue but over time the scar tissue will become less sensitive and blend in more with the rest of your skin nits important to take good care of your skin especially if you have a cut or wound keep the area clean and use a bandage to protect it this can help prevent infection and speed up the healing process,1
the united states was not always one country it started out as 13 colonies that were all separate and independent from each other each of these colonies was founded by different groups of people who came to the new world what is now north and south america for different reasons some people came to the colonies to start new farms and make a new life for themselves others came to the colonies to escape persecution or poverty in their home countries still others came to the colonies to find new opportunities for trade and commercennbecause the colonies were founded by different groups of people at different times and because they were located in different parts of the country they each developed their own unique cultures traditions and ways of life this is one reason why the colonies remained separate and did not unite into one big colonynnover time however the colonies began to work together and trade with each other they also faced common challenges such as dealing with native american tribes and defending themselves against attacks by other countries as a result the colonies decided to form a union and join together to become one country this process was not easy and it took a lot of negotiation and compromise to create the united states as we know it today,1
there are a few reasons why solar power isnt the most widely used source of electricity yet one reason is that it can be expensive to set up a solar power system especially if you need to buy a lot of solar panels and other equipment another reason is that solar power only works when the sun is shining so it can be difficult to use solar power at night or on cloudy days finally some places just dont get very much sunshine which makes it hard to use solar power despite these challenges many people and companies are still interested in using solar power because it is a clean renewable energy source,1
instead of saying which one is better which is too subjective i think it is more important to understand what these institutions are  they are kind of different animals edward jones pretty much a full service wealth manager  they meet with you in person advise you on what retirement and savings accounts to get they talk to you to evaluate your risk preferences  they will talk to you about planning for your kids college and about your insurance situation they will probably attend your kids bar mitzvahs and stuff too  of course this isnt free  with edward jones you will pay a fixed percentage of your managed wealth to them every year  and they will likely put your money in expensive mutual funds  and those mutual funds will charge a special 12b1 fee which is a kickback to the wealth manager  plan on giving 2 or so of your total wealth to the manager per year plus whatever the mutual funds charge   i dont have experience with betterment but they appear to be a robo advisor  robo advisors attempt to do the same kinds of things as wealth managers but rely on computer algorithms and web pages to give you advice whenever possible  this makes some sense because most people arent actually that special in terms of their financial situation  i dont know their cost structure but presumably it will be significantly cheaper than edward jones  they will almost certainly put you in cheaper funds index funds and etfs  think of it as a costconscious alternative to edward jones vanguard is a discount broker and a mutual fund family  their funds are among the biggest and cheapest in the world  fees on many of these funds will be a fraction of the equivalent funds edward jones will put you in  they will charge you nothing at all to manage your money  they will give you some assistance and advice if you call them but dont expect any house calls  they arent particularly in the business of giving advice  if you know what you want to invest in this is the cheapest way to do it by far  basically you wont have to pay anything at all except the actual cost of the assets you are investing in which is the best  depends on your own preferences and ability  if you do not want to learn about personal finance and dont particularly care about whether you are getting the best returnif you dont mind paying for a personal touchedward jones might be a good choice  for most people who are comfortable asking this type of question online and interested in learning about finance even a little bit id expect that betterment or vanguard will be a better choice  for people who are willing to learn a bit of finance and manage their own affairs using vanguard or a close competitor like fidelity will ultimately result in the most wealth generated the least given away to the financial industry,0
circles are 360 degrees because thats just how its always been done people have been measuring angles in circles for a very long time and for some reason they decided to divide a circle into 360 equal parts each of these parts is called a degree and when you add them all up you get 360 degreesnnone way to think about it is to imagine that a circle is like a clock there are 12 hours on a clock and each hour is made up of 60 minutes if you add up all the minutes on the clock you get 720 60 x 12 so if you split a circle into two halves each half would have 360 degrees just like a clock has 360 minutesnnits also worth noting that 360 is a nice round number that is easy to work with it can be divided by lots of other numbers which makes it useful for doing math and measurementsnnso thats why circles are 360 degrees its just a tradition that has been followed for a very long time,1

military equipment is expensive for a few reasons first it is often made with very highquality materials that are designed to last a long time and be able to withstand tough conditions for example a jet has to be able to fly really fast and be able to withstand a lot of stress so it is made with strong lightweight materials like titanium and advanced composites second military equipment is often very complex and requires a lot of research and development to design and build this takes a lot of time and money finally there is often only a small market for military equipment which means that the companies that make it cannot produce as many items as they would if they were making something that lots of people wanted to buy this makes it more expensive to produce each individual item,1

you do not say what country you are in this is an answer for readers in the uk most normal balance transfer deals are only for paying off other credit cards however there are money transfer deals that will pay the money direct to your bank account the deals arent as good as balance transfer deals but they are often a competitive option compared to other types of borrowing  another option depending on how much you need to borrow and your regular spending habits is to get a card with a 0 for purchases deal and use that card for your regular shopping then put the money you would have spent on your regular shopping towards the car,0

people make computer viruses for a variety of reasons but some common motivations include trying to make money trying to cause harm or disruption or trying to gain unauthorized access to systems or information some people who make viruses do so for personal gain such as by creating viruses that display ads or try to steal information that can be sold or used for fraud others may create viruses as a form of revenge or to cause chaos some hackers also create viruses to gain unauthorized access to computer systems or networks which they can then use to steal sensitive information or cause damage overall the main goal of people who make viruses is typically to cause some sort of negative impact or to benefit in some way whether that be financially or through causing disruption or harm,1

whenever a martial artist is breaking something  it will be set up in such a way that it looks far more difficult than it is  they still need the strength and technique  and even if they do it right it can be painful  but ultimately it s just physics  you support relatively thin slabs of concrete at the ends and hit it in the middle  concrete is quite brittle  so as long as you can bend it a little bit  it will snap  you can even go through multiple slabs as long as they re separated  you ll never see somebody punching through a solid foot  thick block of concrete  because breaking the slab relies on the leverage of the relatively long  relatively thin dimensions   see this video   url0  for an example of what i m talking about  it s a fair amount of concrete  but the slabs are arranged in such a way that breaking the first one will almost certainly result in a number of others being broken  but if you try and go through a single slab that thick  the only thing breaking will be your arm  a lot of it comes down to spacers  if you watch a video of a martial artist breaking bricks  you may notice they re not laying flat one on top of the other  if they were  it s unlikely they would be broken  instead  they re separated  sometimes by chop sticks  which means once the amount of force necessary to break the first brick is used to break that brick  you have the added weight from the broken brick to help make up for the loss in force from the initial break  i d not go as far as to call it a scam  but it s not as difficult as it looks  also  and this is nt often spoken of publicly  often times plaster of paris is used in brick breaking demonstrations instead of concrete  as it s brittle and far easier to break while still looking like concrete  if you have an opportunity  pick up the bricks before the presentation  if they re lighter than you expect  it s possible you re dealing with a fraud  it does require skill  hitting with the correct form helps to prevent injury  and it also involves being able to ignore or otherwise deal with the pain which is caused by striking something hard with your bare hand  it s not  however  superhuman  it s a trick  anyone can break boards or concrete with a little practice  the concrete is just the right thickness and set up to maximize leverage  once you know the concrete will give  you can hit it as hard as you want and not have to worry about breaking your hand ,0
in a sense yes theres a view in yahoo finance that looks like this   for this particular stock a market order for 3000 shares not even 4000 this is a reasonably small figure will move the stock past 134 more than a 3 move  say on the ask side there are 100000 shares all with 10 ask it would take a lot of orders to purchase all these shares so for a while the price may stay right at 10 or a bit lower if there are those willing to sell lower  but say that side showed 10 1000 1025 500 1050 1000 now the volume is so low that if i decided i wanted shares at any price my order a market order will actually drive the market price right up to 1050 if i buy 2500 shares market  you see however even though im a small trader i drove the price up but now that the price is 1050 when i go to sell all 2500 at 1050 there are no bids to pay that much so the price the next trade will occur at isnt known yet there may be bids at 10 with asking me at 1050 no trades will happen until a seller takes the 10 bid or other buyers and sellers come in,0
when a company writes something off it means that the company is removing the value of an asset from its balance sheet this is typically done because the asset is no longer useful or valuable to the company or because the company has incurred a loss that it cant recover for example if a company buys a piece of equipment and then decides that it no longer needs it it might write the equipment off by taking the value of the equipment off of its balance sheetrnrnas an individual you can also write things off on your taxes if they are related to your business or job this means that you can deduct the cost of certain expenses from your taxable income which can lower the amount of taxes you have to pay for example if you are selfemployed and you buy a computer for your business you can write off the cost of the computer on your taxesrnrni hope this helps to explain what it means to write something off let me know if you have any other questions,1

marketing  republicans have been very skillful in marketing themselves as the party of the  average joe  while painting the democrats as the party of the  liberal elite   you are operating under the assumption that democrats are always best for poor people  that s not always the case  for example  many low income people were significantly impacted in a negative way due to obamacare  additionally  many low income people are negatively impacted due to lack of school choice and union pandering  etc  very few people are single issue voters and the poor already do nt pay income tax  a few years ago only something like 47  of americans paid income tax   and things like the carbon tax and purposefully keeping oil prices high through taxation and refusing to drill locally in an attempt to keep consumption down  etc  things like that inversely impact the poor far more than they do the wealthy  look at it this way  if you re at a certain income level the democrats want to send your kids to a shitty school that fails to educate them in order to placate the unions  they want to mandate you purchase overpriced healthcare insurance with deductibles so high you ca nt use it anyway or you ll pay a penalty  they want you to pay more on your heating and utilities because they do nt want you to use as much oil  they want to reduce your employment options by making gasoline more expensive so you wo nt drive as much  they want tax to your nicotine addiction so highly that you ca nt afford to save for retirement  speaking of which they do nt want to fix social security to ensure you will receive something when you retire  they want to give out millions of working papers to illegal immigrants to compete against you for entry level positions keeping you under or unemployed  etc  the list goes on and on  while they do favor additional handouts  their entire platform is nt always in the best interest of the poor  under republicans  the rich get much richer and poor get much poorer  under democrats  everybody gets a little bit poorer ,0

some fields need it more than others  some high skill fields are constantly in demand  so people in those fields do nt really need to unionize to ensure they get fair pay and good benefits  other fields are more easily replaced  however  so unions are more beneficial for them  unions are pretty old  so a lot of unions exist due to tradition  most of what comes to mind is a blue collar factory or mill worker  these positions do nt offer much room for advancement  and the  working class hero  ideology does nt particularly want to push for other types of work  however  these people still have families  therefore  they still need proper wages to support their families and formed unions to collectively bargain against the much fewer management  employers  the other factor  is that these people are relatively permanent  therefore they can and will stick around in one place to continually fight for more rights  jobs such as retail or restaurant service do nt usually have permanent staff  people tend to rotate in and out more  this makes unionization difficult  since not enough people are around enough to continually push for a specific agenda  corporations also tend to move their management around more as well and keep the decision making people further away  so there s not going to be much change if you ca nt contact the same people  or if you ca nt contact them at all  history plays a part  too  in the southern us  textile mill workers began to form unions around the same time as the northern factories and steel mills  the northern cities  workers found great success  earning unions clout and prestige  the southern workers ended up getting shafted when their union efforts were stomped out and self  imploded  the attitudes about the worth of unions are still generally reflected in this split today  though after several generations and ever  increasing worker mobility  it is diluted ,0
when you take a picture of an image on your computer monitor the picture may appear strange or have a lot of lines when you zoom in because the image on your computer screen is made up of tiny pixels which are small colored dots that form the image when you take a picture of the screen with a camera the cameras sensor also picks up these pixels and they can appear as lines or blocks in the picture especially if you zoom in this is because the cameras sensor does not have the same resolution as the screen so it cannot capture all of the pixels in the image in the same level of detailrnrnthink of it like this imagine trying to draw a picture of a house using only big squares of color like a mosaic if you stood far away from the picture it might look like a house but if you got up close you would be able to see the individual squares and the picture would not look as smooth thats similar to what happens when you take a picture of an image on a computer screen the image is made up of lots of tiny pixels and when you zoom in you can see the individual pixels more clearly,1
when a fighter pilot performs intense turns or other maneuvers that generate a lot of gforces the blood in their body is pulled towards their feet away from their head and brain this can cause a decrease in blood flow to the brain and lead to a condition called grayout or blackout if the blood flow to the brain is reduced for too long the pilot can lose consciousnessnnoxygen masks help prevent this from happening by providing the pilot with a constant supply of oxygen when the brain doesnt get enough oxygen it cant function properly which can lead to a blackout by wearing an oxygen mask the pilot can make sure that their brain is getting the oxygen it needs even during intense maneuvers,1
i think that if the price does not go very far up then your order will open on 101 because you are setting a limit order if suddenly the price goes up very quickly or with a gep even then you may not be given a position but this is with a limit order and it is better to check with the broker there are also warrants in which you can adjust the price range for example from 101 to 103 and at a sharp price jump it is possible for you and would not give a position at a price of 101 but perhaps 103 would get,0
it does nt make sense to folks who ca nt get past the  religion  part  to put it simply  churches provide a public good  both to the constituent populations and the public  at  large  so  say someone looks at a church  they see a building  with religious people inside  and think  what do they do for me  why should they get a tax exemption   three weeks later  their part of town floods  a few hundred people  more than it would be reasonable for the red cross to put up in hotel rooms  guess where the shelter has a high  liklihood of being set up  the church  guess who is most likely in the church s kitchen cooking breakfast  assembling lunch  preparing dinner  the church members  churches do a lot of good in the communities they reside in  of all faiths  for all faiths or complete lack there of  if someone walks into a church  any denomination or faith  and asks to see the minister  they re in crisis  they will see the minister  who will sit down with them  hear what they re having issues with  and either offer advice and counseling  put them in touch with social and other community services  or help them right then and there  i was traveling cross country and left my wallet at a restaurant a few hours behind me  it was a small town  and i stopped by the local catholic church  i told the father straight up i m not a catholic  and he jokingly said  nobody s perfect   put me up in a room of the church for the night  someone took me out to breakfast the next morning  the fueled up my car  handed me  40 cash incase i needed another fuel  up  and sent me on my way  i needed help  and they helped out  i drove back to the diner  got my wallet  bought an envelope and a stamp  stuffed  100 cash from an atm into the envelope  and when driving back through town stopped at the local po and dropped the letter in the mail  if it had not been for the kindness and generosity of a community i m politically at odds with  i would have been up  a  creek without a paddle  could i have gotten assistance some other way  sure  but a church is a clearly  visible place to seek guidance  help  or if you re into it  faith  it was a logical place to go  do churches turn people away  all the time  especially if they have reason to believe they re pulling a fast one on them  as a red cross volunteer  we set up shelters at religious centers of all faiths  from buddhist to muslim  many times and every time they responded with generosity unbelievable for people who were not of their faith  we can disagree with the faith and politics of any particular faith or religious groups  but more often than not they re out there doing some of the grimy dirty work helping the poor and affected by disaster  personal and regional  i m part of a uu church that takes turns with other churches of other faiths and denominations to house homeless women one night a week  we cook for them  we make sure they have toiletries and things for the night  and stand guard over them while they sleep  and feed them in the morning before sending them off  some women were there by choice  druggies and the like  others through situations beyond their control  this is why faith groups have religious exemption  and why they always will  they re npos  non  profit organizations  how can you tax something that is nt operating to create profit  they re a nonprofit  but if you re asking why they get a special classification apart from nonprofit status with special exemptions it s complicated  1  if you have the gov  going through the books  of churches then you open up an issue of infringement of religious expression  ex  why this church audited and not the other  2  it s partially a layover culturally from the time when the church was a legitimate counterpart to the state in terms of power  taxing the church  unthinkable for most of history since the establishment of christianity  3  despite what young redditors like presumably you and i are tell you  most people still have some connection to a church or religion in general  the government telling churches to do anything is a touchy subject  if you want proof look at any attempt by states to require any educational standards in religious schools  this is one of the many  many things that maintain the special status of churches in the us tax code  i m sure there s a few books about it  which i feel like i need to read now ,0

in the united states there are levels of government  federal government  state government  county  not important in some states   city  town etc  each state government has a lot of latitude in passing laws as they see fit  essentially free of federal interference  as long as their laws abide by the constitution and certain other laws  the people in states elect members of congress who serve in the senate and in the house of representatives  dc lacks a state government  and the city government is subservient to the federal government  the constitution provides for dc to be ruled directly by congress and the federal government  article i  section 8  various methods delegated the task in the past  including the appointed position of governor  and a board of commissioners  in recent decades  the elected office of mayor was put in place and an elected city council was created  which writes and votes on laws  but all laws they pass still require the ok of congress to go into effect  this is known as home rule   the residents of dc also do not have voting members of congress  there are no senators for dc  there is a member of the house of representatives who is a non  voting member  until recently  dc residents could nt vote for president  but this was changed and dc now has electoral votes which equal what they would get  if  a state  but ca nt be more than the smallest state  this is from the 23rd amendment   the district of columbia is a federal district originally envisioned as a place without permanent residents  ie everyone there would be a resident of one of the states   if you ve been here  basically what currently exists from the white house  capital to the potomac  like most us structures when the nation was founded it s a product of comprimise between the north and south  that s why it s very close to the border between northern and southern states  and when selected the district was between two towns  georgetown and alexandria  on land that was nt very good for farming  legally  as it s not a state  the district does nt elect senators and their representative in the house does nt actually get to vote on bills  congress funds a non  insignificant portion of the districts budget  and has some oversight authority over the city council s laws  dc does not have representation in congress hence the license plates say  taxation without representation  as kind of a joke  techically dc is administered by congress  but generally they let the  elected  municipal government run things  so it s not much different from any other big city ,0
outlet plugs have different numbers of prongs because they are designed to fit into different types of outlets some outlets have two slots while others have three the outlets with three slots are typically grounded outlets which means they are connected to a ground wire that helps to protect against electrical shocks the third prong on the plug is used to connect to this ground wire the twopronged plugs are used with outlets that do not have a ground wire and are sometimes called ungrounded outlets,1
people are given sentences of 200 years or more in prison as a way to punish them for very serious crimes it is a way for the court to say that the person will be punished for a very long time even if they do not live to be 200 years old in some cases a person might be given a sentence of 200 years or more because they have committed multiple crimes and the court wants to make sure they are punished for each onernrnits important to remember that being sentenced to prison is meant to be a punishment and the length of the sentence is one way to make sure the person is held accountable for their actions even if someone is given a long sentence like 200 years they may still have the opportunity to be released from prison early if they show that they have learned from their mistakes and are ready to follow the rules and laws of society,1

scientists use the international system of units si for measurements including weight the standard unit of weight in the si system is the kilogram kg a kilogram is a unit of mass which is a measure of how much matter is in an object mass is different from weight which is a measure of the force of gravity on an object the weight of an object depends on the mass of the object and the strength of the gravitational field it is inrnrnfor example the weight of an object that has a mass of 1 kilogram on earth is about 98 newtons n the weight of the same object on the moon where the gravitational field is weaker would be about 16 nrnrnso to compare the weight of an object on different planets or in different gravitational fields scientists use the unit of mass which is the kilogram this allows them to compare the amount of matter in different objects regardless of the strength of the gravitational field they are in,1

its important to note that the cleveland kidnapper ariel castro was only charged with 977 counts in relation to the kidnapping and abuse of three women amanda berry gina dejesus and michelle knight these three women were held captive in castros home for several years and were subjected to physical sexual and emotional abuse the large number of charges that castro faced reflects the severity and duration of the crimes that he committed against these three women each count likely represents a specific instance of abuse or a violation of the law for example there may have been charges for kidnapping rape assault and unlawful imprisonment among others its also worth noting that some of the charges may have been for offenses that took place over a period of time rather than for a single incident for example if castro was charged with a count of kidnapping for each day that the women were held captive that could contribute to the large number of charges i hope this helps to clarify the situation if you have any other questions please dont hesitate to ask,1
wealth inequality refers to the gap between the rich and the poor in a society it can be a bad thing because it can lead to a number of negative consequencesone reason is that it can create social and economic divisions within a society when some people have a lot of wealth and others have very little it can lead to feelings of resentment and frustration among those who are not as well off this can create tension and conflict within a society and it can make it difficult for people to work together to solve problems and address common challengesanother reason is that wealth inequality can have negative impacts on the economy as a whole when a small group of people have a disproportionate amount of wealth they may not have the same incentives to spend and invest in the economy as people who have less wealth this can lead to slower economic growth and reduced opportunities for everyonefinally wealth inequality can lead to a lack of opportunity for people who are not as well off when the rich have a lot of wealth and resources they may be able to access better education healthcare and other opportunities that can help them succeed this can create a cycle where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer making it harder for those who are not as well off to improve their circumstancesoverall while its not necessarily a bad thing to have some people who are very wealthy its important to try to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to succeed and that there is a reasonable balance of wealth within a society,1

it s a social norm that beating up women makes you look like a coward or weak  the  do nt hit girls  has been a mantra i ve heard many times in my childhood  it s not very manly to make yourself look like a coward for going after the weak  fighting and beating up other men however is in some circles seen as macho  statistics are skewed towards what is considered socially acceptable  sexual violence towards women is scandalous and tittilating  and so statistics are played up for it  while sexual violence against men is weird and taboo  and so it is downplayed and not reported  often the very definition of sexual violence requires that the victim be female  as for other kinds of violence  it is probably true that men experience more violence  for many lower  class men violence is pretty much a way of life  the violence is bi  directional  people have less empathy for men because they are bigger and stronger  and women have more neotenous features  and so men are considered  fair game   as a cop i can say that in my experience  most male victims of violent crimes are criminals themselves  it s rare to go to a homicide  shooting  violent assault  etc and the victim not be a career criminal  drug dealer  or gang member  usually they ll be a suspect in a shooting or robbery against the suspect in thier attack  that s just my experience in my little corner of the world  though most of the other officers i talk to around tyne country have the same experience ,0

they inside of a submarine only has to be pressurized to normal atmospheric pressure  this allows people to live and function normally  the outer hull is nt that strong and just protects the sub from wear and tear  the pressure hull however is extremely strong and fights the huge force from the pressure due to the weight of all the water above it  in between the outer hull and pressure hull is a space that is equal to the pressure outside of the sub  but most of the sub is within the pressure hull and has normal sea level pressure  on some subs the pressure hull and outer hull are one and the same but the pressure hull is then more likely to get damaged plus it has to be bigger so it costs more  most submarines are pressurised at basically normal atmospheric pressure  like military submarines  so the crew can work and breath just like on the surface  even if they are far underwater  these subs have really strong hulls that are able to keep the enormous water pressure out  even with normal atmosphere inside  these subs are usually really big  heavy  and expensive  and even though they can dive pretty deep  they mostly ca nt go to the really deep places in the ocean  one way to make a submarine able to dive deeper  and require a less bulky and expensive hull  is to make the air pressure inside the sub much higher than normal  this means it a little bit easier for the hull to keep the water pressure out  since there is a little less difference in pressure  it is of course  much harder for humans to live and breath normally in this high pressure air  different concentrations of oxygen in the air have to be used  and often the air is mixed with weird mixes of different gasses just so the people can breath in the high pressure air  but if you want to dive really deep  and not have a crazy massive hull  sometimes its necessary to have high pressure inside your vehicle  so you can keep the water pressure outside from crushing your submarine  the outer shell does not have to be hard enough to withstand the  pressure difference   it just needs to be hard enough to protect the pressure hull from things knocking into it and damaging it while it is straining under the difference between the inside the sub and the pressure from outside  the outer hull is feeling the some pressure on both sides of it so it does not have to resist the  pressure difference   think of putting a sheet of metal into the water  as long as the water is on both sides is the same it will not deform or strain ,0
water is a conductor which means it can allow electricity to flow through it when electrical components are exposed to water the water can cause a short circuit which is when electricity flows through an unintended path a short circuit can cause the component to stop working or even become damagednnfor example if you put a flashlight in water without batteries the flashlight will not work because there is no electricity to power it however if you put a flashlight in water with batteries the water can cause a short circuit which can cause the batteries to leak or even explode and the flashlight to stop working or become damagednnits important to keep electrical components dry to prevent them from being damaged by water if you accidentally get an electrical component wet you should dry it off as soon as possible to help prevent damage even if you do dry it off completely its possible that the component may have been damaged and may not work properly,1
low interest rates can stimulate investment in the stock market and other investments by making it cheaper for businesses to borrow money this can encourage companies to invest in new projects and expand their operations which can lead to increased profits and higher stock prices low interest rates can also make other investments such as bonds less attractive relative to stocks which can encourage investors to put more money into the stock markethowever its important to note that the relationship between interest rates and the stock market is complex and can vary over time factors such as economic growth corporate earnings and investor sentiment can also have a significant impact on the stock market in addition low interest rates alone do not guarantee increased investment or higher stock prices,1

there are many different types of seizures  all of which probably feel very different  but  i can tell you about the one i had  i was sitting at the computer and everything suddenly started tilting and sliding  from my perspective it was like the entire room just suddenly tilted and slid to the right  looking back later  i realize that i was falling out of my chair  but i could nt feel my body so i did nt know i was actually falling  one of my relatives was there and i remember seeing his face above me  i did nt know at the time  but i was lying on the ground   i desperately wanted to tell him that i was okay  so i tried forming the words  but i could nt say anything  in that moment i felt terrified because  if i could nt even  say  that i was okay  clearly i was not okay  and something was horribly wrong  i remember that i could nt even tell if my mouth was open or closed  or where anything was  it was incredibly confusing  i later learned that my relative had stuck his hand in my mouth to prevent me from swallowing my tongue  which is not actually recommended now  i do nt think  but was something he had heard to do   to this day i do nt know if i was just laying there completely still or if my body was seizing and thrashing around  i never asked  no one ever told me  and i had no feeling in my body for the entire episode  it lasted about thirty seconds  probably  this happened over ten years ago so the memories are probably a bit fuzzy  i ve had two seizures and it is a surreal experience to say the least  experiences vary from individual to individual because there are many different kinds of seizures that involve different areas of the brain  in my case  i had a seizure that began in my auditory cortex  hearing center  that evolved into a generalized  full brain  seizure  at the beginning  when the seizure was contained to my auditory cortex  i retained consciousness and remember having auditory hallucinations  for me  the sound of rushing water  and hearing the voice of my history teacher from high school   at this point i became very confused and was unable to talk  the seizure was spreading to other parts of my brain  i then lost feeling in my limbs  as the seizure continued to spread to other areas of my brain  i felt very frightened  within a minute or two  i completely lost consciousness  and according to my family collapsed and began shaking violently  during this time the seizure was occurring in my entire brain  this lasted for several minutes  the time shortly after a seizure is generally the most unpleasant part  it is common to have injuries from the convulsions  for instance a broken nose  cuts in ones mouth  and even a dislocated shoulder are common  consciousness returns slowly  in my case i was disoriented for at least an hour after both of my seizures  i had no memory of the event and did not know why i was at the hospital until someone explained that i had a seizure  memories from shortly before and shortly after the seizure slowly returned  and within the day i returned to full cognitive function  if i were to compare a seizure to a common experience  it feels like waking up from a disturbing and surreal dream that lingers with you for the rest of the day  again  this was my individual experience  it is subjective  and many other people will have different stories and experiences  seizures feel different for everyone  but i m happy to share my experience  i have temporal lobe epilepsy  unmedicated  i have up to five seizures per day  most of them complex partial  medicated  yay medical marijuana   i average less than one seizure a week  before i have a seizure  i get this really intense feeling of dread  that feeling is the warning  aura and it gives me less than 30 seconds to sit  i get super hot then super cold and my vision goes all tunnely  then it s just a feeling of detached discomfort until it s over  my eyes twitchroll back  but i do nt feel  notice it because i ca nt see during most seizures  during a seizure  i can sometimes hear what s said to me  but i ca nt respond  or  if i can  i ll say the same thing over and over  it s frustrating as hell and makes me feel like my brain is trapped in a puppet s body ,0
our sense of disgust is a way to stop us getting bad germs in to our bodies  this is why we do nt drink gone off milk  our noses are pretty good at telling us what is bad and what is good hence why we can smell whether food is good or bad  this sense is triggered when smelling a fart  only the understanding that it was your fart puts you at ease from being disgusted  since if it came from you it s less likely to have germs that were nt in you already  a great test for this is when two people fart silently at the same time  both are comfortable with the smell only till they realize someone else farted  any smell you stay in the vicinity of for too long  the stink goes away eventually  even if it s someone else s poop  but of course no one stays long enough near someone else s poop  because that would be just weird  i read once that the reason someone else s poo smells so badly is that it s because you would know that it is  unsafe  eg not to eat it  it s basically a way of your brain to tell you that it is  unsafe   some sort of warning  the reason that your own poo doenst smell so bad to you is because you know that it is in fact poo and not something else so that warning is redundant  if it is nt true please correct me  i just read it too ,0

mosquitoes are small insects that are found all around the world they are known for biting humans and animals and sucking their blood while mosquitoes may be annoying to some people they are actually very important for our ecosystems if all the mosquitoes in the world disappeared it would have a number of different effects on the environment first of all many animals rely on mosquitoes as a source of food for example many birds bats and other insects eat mosquitoes if there were no more mosquitoes these animals would have to find a new food source which could be difficult in addition mosquitoes play a role in pollinating flowers and plants when they feed on nectar they help to spread pollen from one plant to another which is important for the growth and reproduction of many plants finally mosquitoes are also important because they help to control the populations of other insects mosquitoes prey on many other insects such as flies which can help to keep their populations in check overall while mosquitoes may be a nuisance to humans they are actually essential to the health and balance of our ecosystems,1
i thought these monks were supposed to be highly logical  if that were true  after hearing what the doctor had said  they simply would nt look at anyone else s forehead  ever  they would then never know they had the disease and then they d never die from it  assume you re the only monk with a red dot on your forehead  you see no red dots on any other forehead and you know there is at least one red dot  it must be on your forehead  since you know that you have the disease  you die on that day  assume a different scenario where you see one and only one monk with a red dot  he must die that day  unless you also have a red dot  the next morning he is still alive  so you know you have the red dot too  you two are the only ones who have it  you both know it  you both die that day  now let s skip ahead  imagine a scenario whre you see 12 red dots on 12 different monks  on the 12th day  they do not die  this proves to you that they also saw 12 dots  each one not knowing that they had one on their foreheads  this also proves to you that you have a dot  since everyone now knows if they have a dot on their foreheads  the infected monks die that day  this is a great opportunity to learn about a powerful mathematical tool called  induction   url0  which can solve this problem  induction requires a   base case   and an   inductive hypothesis    do nt worry too much about these terms now  i ll come back to them later  let s say that only one monk has the disease  that monk would see that no one else has a red dot  and would die in the night  this is the simplest example for which the problem makes sense  after all  the doctor did say  at least one  of the monks had the disease  that s why the one  monk case is our   base case    now let s say that two monks have the disease  and say that i m the second monk   if the other monk did nt see a red dot on my forehead  he would have died on the first night   he did nt die on the first night  so he must have seen a red dot on my forehead  therefore i have the disease   both of us are thinking the same thoughts  so we will both die tonight  that was our   inductive hypothesis    now here s the beauty of induction  things may seem more complicated with more monks  but they really are nt  let s just look at the three  monk case  and say that i m the third monk   if i did nt have the disease  we d be looking at a case where only two monks have the disease   we already know what happens in the two  monk case  both of the monks should die on the second night   after the second night  i see that neither of the other monks seem to be dead  my assumption  that i do nt have the disease  must be wrong  therefore i have the disease  now we can repeat exactly this logic with four monks  then five  then six  it builds up to any number of monks you can think of  that s the beauty of induction  ps in mathematical parlance  we say that knowing the answer for  k  monks allows us to find the answer for  k1  monks ,0

mdtech answered the answer is in your question derivatives are contracts so are enforced in the same way as any other contract  if the counterparty refuses to pay immediately they will in the first instance be billed by any intermediary prime broker etc that facilitated the contract if they still refuse to pay the contract may stipulate that a broker can net off any outstanding payments against it or pay out using deposited cash or posted margins the contract will usually include the broker as an interested party and so they can but dont need to report a default such that this is to credit agencies in some jurisdictions they are required to by law any parties to the trade and the courts may use a debt collection agency to collect payments or seize assets to cover payment if there is no broker or the counterparty still has not paid the bill then the parties involved the party to the trade and any intermediaries can sue for breach of contract if they win which would be expected the counterparty will be made to pay by the legal system including but not limited to seizure of assets enforced bankruptcy and prison terms for any contempts of court rulings all of this holds for governments who refuse to pay derivatives losses as argentina did in the early 20th century but in that case it may escalate as far as war it has never done so for derivatives contracts as far as i know but other breaches of contract between countries have resulted in armed conflict as well as the hard results of failing to pay there are soft implications including a guaranteed fall in credit ratings that will result in parties refusing to do business with the counterparty and a separate loss of reputation that will reduce business even further potential employees and funders will be unwilling to become involved with such a party and suppliers will be unwilling to supply on credit the end result in almost every way would be bankruptcy and prison sentences for the party or their senior employees most jurisdictions allow for board members at companies in material breach of contract to be banned from running any company for a set period as well edit netting off cash flows netting off is a process whereby all of a partys cash flows positive and negative are used to pay each other off so that only the net change is reflected in account balances for example company 1 cash flows netting off the total outgoings are 3m  500k  35m and total incomings are 12m  11m  12m  35m so the incoming cash flows can be used to pay the outgoing cash flows leaving a net payment into company1s account of 0,0

bradley manning allegedly copied a vast amount of classified information and leaked it to the internet  the government says this leak was not only illegal but harmed a lot of people  people who want the government to be more open think this is a good thing  christ  you kids grow up so fast  the truth here is nt black and white  he s not a traitor  but he s certainly not a hero  you see  manning worked in a position through the us military that allowed him access to privileged information  like what you would write down in your journal kiddo  now  think about when you re brother took your journal from you and started reading it to your friends  some things  they probably should have known about  if mikey smells  he needs to know to get a bath   however some of these things did nt need to be released  when your brother told everyone that you said christy likes andy  that was a breach of trust between not only you and your brother but likely hurt your friendship with christy as well  right   here s where it gets a bit more complicated  slugger  some of the information that bradley released did nt just hurt feelings  it could have physically hurt people  good people  like andy s mom and dad  bradley was entrusted with this information  and made a pinky promise to protect it  he promised so hard that he told everyone that if he were to ever break his promise  he should be punished  that s a pretty big promise  grown ups do nt always think things through when they say them  though  they can be very selfish  you remember that word from class right  some grownups believe that the information he was promising to protect should belong to everyone  these people fully believe that bradley is a hero for doing so  because it helps people like mikey know that he needs to shower  these people forget that people s feelings get hurt when people break promises  and sometimes worse than just that  other people want to claim that he s a traitor  that s not correct either  buddy  you ll learn all about this more when you get to be a big kid  but being a traitor is a very specific type bad person  in fact  it s the only crime that s written into the constitution  i know you do nt really know what that means yet  so think of it like the house rules that mommy and daddy have for you  we have these rules to make sure that everything goes smooth  as well as keep everyone safe  anyways  these people think that bradley should get more punishment than he s currently getting  now  you know i worked with andy s mom and dad when i was in the military  so i could have been one of the people that got hurt when bradley broke his promise  bradley deserves to be punished  and i promise you he will be  but he does nt deserve to be punished for things he did nt do  when you steal a cookie from the cookie jar  we give you a time out for stealing and ground you for lying  i ca nt punish you for something that you did nt do simply because i m mad  that brings us up to today  when grown ups get in trouble  even in the military  they re allowed to have what we call a  trial  where other grown ups talk about what they did and see how they should be punished  bradley has nt had a chance to defend himself yet  but that s partially his fault  see  he told the grown ups defending him that they should do the trial later so they would have more time to decide what to say at it  unfortunately  this means he has to stay in time out  because when you join the military and make these promises to protect secrets or else be punished  they make you keep them  what makes it worse is that some mean grown ups made his time out worse than it should have been at first  time out is nt fun  you know this  but it should nt be mean  these people were told that what they re doing is nt ok  and they made his time out a bit more fair  i wish i could tell you for certain if he s a good guy or a bad guy  champ  you ll learn when you grow up that very few things are that simple  bradley will get punished for breaking his promises  and i can promise you that a lot of people are like daddy and we want to make sure his punishment is fair  i hope this helped you understand a bit better  now grab your glove  let s go play catch  let s consider something that happened 60 years ago  the  pentagon papers   url0  these papers proved lies and criminal duplicity in government that bordered on treason  which is more criminal  releasing the papers or crime of perpetuating war  was daniel ellsberg a hero or a criminal ,0
there is always random noise in television feed  when the tv is receiving a stronger channel  the signal drowns out the noise  when the tv is receiving a weaker signal  or no signal at all  the noise drowns out the signal  for example  when you are in a movie theater and the movie is on and blaring music  you ca nt hear the air  conditioning  shuffles of feet  etc  however  when a quite scene is up  you can easily hear the air  conditioning and other ambient noise  the same happens with tv signals  radio signals get picked up at hugely different levels of power  since amplifiers only have a relatively small range that the input can handle  there is basically a radio frequency pre  amplifier that is designed to automatically boost the small signal enough that the audio frequency amplifier can handle it  when the signal is really really small  or completely gone   the pre  amplifier turns itself up so high that the random jittering of atoms in the receiver gets picked up and amplified billions of times  this can be because of heat  thermal noise  interference  electrical noise  or random background radiation  cosmic noise sources   basically static is the receiver reacting to the tiniest little disturbances  partly it s background radiation from the  big bang   url0  ,0

when you delete a file on a computer it doesnt actually disappear right away instead the computer just marks the space that the file was using as available for new data to be written to it the files contents are still there on the hard drive but the computer doesnt know how to find it anymorennthere are ways to recover deleted files but its not always easy its often possible to use special software to scan the hard drive and find the deleted files data however the longer you wait and the more you use the computer the harder it becomes to recover the deleted file because the computer may have already written new data over the old datannto truly make information irrecoverable you would need to completely destroy the hard drive this could be done by physically smashing it melting it or using strong magnets to erase the data however these methods would also destroy the hard drive so it wouldnt be usable anymore,1
never heard lieutenant pronounced like that  but i m pretty sure francois is pronounced franswah  spoken language changes a lot more easily than written language  for example  english s writing standard has its roots back around the 14th century  600  700 years ago  and since then spoken english has changed a lot  case in point  the silent  gh  in  night  was actually pronounced like german  ch   and the  i  was pronounced like the  ee  in  seen  instead of the  ah  ee  sound it is now  as for those examples you have  all those words are taken from french  which has a very different spelling system to english  that does nt quite explain the pronunciations  though  more specifically   colonel  was originally  coronel  and pronounced like that  the spelling changed to use an  l  due to the italian  colonella   but ultimately the old pronunciation kept   lieutenant  is an odd case  no one knows for sure why it s sometimes pronounced that way  there are cases of it being spelt like that back during the 14th century  so it s not a new thing by any means  i ve never heard  envelope  like that  but i imagine that would be an attempt to mimic the way  enveloppe  is said in french  where  en  does sound somewhat like  on    franã§ois  is usually said more like   frahnswah    which is a fair approximation of how it is in french  people using   frank   for the first syllable is nt that surprising due to the similarities between  francis  and  franã§ois   which are variants of the same name in different languages anyway  swapping out  w  for  v  and vice versa is nt unheard of  that probably accounts for  envelope  s pronunciation too   etymonline   url1  is really useful in detailing the history of different words   wiktionary   url0  is also good for this  envelope is a french loan word  in french  the begginning letters would be pronounced more similar to a long  an   however  i m pretty sure you could pronounce it as it is spelled in english as well  then there s hundreds of different dialects that have set their own spin on the pronounciation of a word ,0
color blindness is caused by a genetic variation that affects the way the brain processes certain colors it is more common in males than females because the genetic variation responsible for color blindness is located on the x chromosome which males only have one of females have two x chromosomes because males only have one x chromosome they are more likely to be affected by color blindness if they inherit the genetic variation from their mother nso to explain it like youre five color blindness is a special way that some peoples brains see colors that is different from most people boys are more likely to be colorblind than girls because it is something that is passed down from their mother,1

brake horsepower is how much power the engine puts out  horsepower is how much of that power actually gets to the wheels  brake horsepower is crank horsepower  and  horsepower  by itself should also be what the engine generates  same as brake or crank  i disagree with  realigion  here    horsepower  by itself is generally not horsepower at the wheels  wheel horsepower  whp   it may not be wrong to say horsepower to mean wheel horsepower  namely because horsepower itself has many forms and definitions  see  wiki   url1    but most people choose to make the distinction  hp  crank  bhp  whp  horsepower as measured at wheels   brake horsepower  bhp  is the measure of an engine s horsepower before the loss in power caused by  many variables  such as gearbox  etc     effective  true  thp  or commonly referred to as wheel horsepower  whp    torque is a different measurement  generally torque is labeled as  twisting force  whereas horsepower is  actual work output or work done   if i m not mistaken  horsepower itself is simply a measurement derived from torque when you see a dynograph  usually a machine that measures wheel horsepower   you ll notice that  if the graph is to scale between torque and horsepower  the two lines cross at 5252 rpm  this is because horsepower is derived from the equation   hp   torque  rpm   5252   url0   as pointed out elsewhere  you can have torque without movement  horsepower   eg horsepower  100 ft lbs  0 rpm  5252  0  therefore  horsepower is equal to zero because  although you re applying force  without an rpm your equation  your horsepower  your work output  is zero   thanks   browsofsteel  for the clarification  torque is basically how hard something can  twist  or  turn  ,0
occupy wall street was a protest movement that began in 2011 in new york city and spread to other cities around the world the protesters were concerned about economic inequality and the influence of large corporations on government policiesnnthe movement gained a lot of attention and support but it did not achieve its specific goals some people argue that it did succeed in raising awareness about these issues and inspiring other movements and protests however the movement eventually dissipated and the protests stoppednnits important to remember that social and political change can be a slow and complicated process and its not always possible to see the direct results of a particular event or movement however its possible that the ideas and values of the occupy wall street movement continue to influence public discourse and policy in some way,1

there are time restrictions on the sale of alcohol in many places because alcohol can be harmful if consumed in excess these time restrictions are put in place to try to reduce the chances of people drinking too much and causing problems such as getting into fights or driving while intoxicated it is also thought that time restrictions can help to reduce the number of young people who might be able to purchase alcohol as they are less likely to be out and about late at night when the restrictions are in place so the time restrictions are put in place to help keep people safe and reduce the chances of problems occurring because of alcohol consumption,1
sure a 32bit computer is a type of computer that can process data using 32bit numbers a 64bit computer is a type of computer that can process data using 64bit numbers the difference between the two is the amount of data that they can process at once imagine that you have a bucket that you use to carry water a 32bit bucket can hold up to 32 ounces of water at a time while a 64bit bucket can hold up to 64 ounces of water at a time if you have a lot of water to carry the 64bit bucket will be able to do it faster because it can hold more water at a time in the same way a 64bit computer can process more data at once than a 32bit computer this means that a 64bit computer may be able to run certain programs faster than a 32bit computer especially if the program requires a lot of data to be processed so when you see that a program is available in both 32bit and 64bit versions you can choose the version that is best for your computer based on whether it is a 32bit or 64bit machine if you have a 64bit computer you may want to use the 64bit version of the program because it may be able to run faster however if you have a 32bit computer you will need to use the 32bit version of the program,1

water can evaporate even if its not at boiling point when water is at room temperature some of the molecules will have enough energy to break free from the others and turn into a vapor this process is called evaporationnnimagine a puddle of water on the ground some of the water molecules will be moving around very fast while others will be moving more slowly the fastmoving molecules will have more energy so they are more likely to break free from the others and turn into a vapor as this happens the water in the puddle will start to get less and less until it has all evaporatednnso even if the water isnt hot enough to boil some of the molecules will still be able to escape and turn into a vapor causing the water to evaporate,1
besides the other problems  heating tires enough to melt ice  snow fast enough would require your tires to be metal and glowing  hot  which would hinder traction as you skittered around on a layer of steam  it would be wildly  insanely  stupid expensive and completely ineffective anyway  if you want to flash melt the snow  your tires will have to be hot  the tires would probably be nickel  for durability  and it would have to be red hot  where is the energy going to come from to generate that heat  some onboard nuclear reactor  then you d need heat shielding to keep the radiant heat from melting the suspension  wheel wells  and so on  you d need to shield to prevent the radiant heat from melting neighboring cars  sign posts  nearby bushes and trees  and people  and the car would have to carry the weight of the energy source and the shielding  the fuel costs would be outrageous  and each tire would probably weight 300 lbs each  you d need a braking system that can stop that much rotational mass  so borrow a braking system from commercial aircraft  and the penumatics to drive the brakes  and that still does nt help stop you because those wheels would just slide on the pavement like skates on ice anyway  and then consider those tires would also melt the pavement and be a huge liability  maintainance would be a nightmare   what if they were just heated  it s simply ineffective  not enough heat  not enough exposure to that much snow and ice  and the heat would dry age the rubber until the tires started dry rotting  it s so much cheaper to just plough and salt  because then the roads would get wet and then freeze and turn into ice also it would make so much steam that you d have no visual,0

there are a few benefits to having a dieselpowered vehicle instead of a gasolinepowered one diesel fuel is generally more efficient than gasoline which means that a diesel engine can get more miles out of a gallon of fuel than a gasoline engine can this means that you might be able to save money on fuel costs if you drive a diesel vehicle diesel engines also tend to last longer than gasoline engines so you might be able to save money on maintenance and repairs in the long run finally diesel engines can produce less greenhouse gas emissions than gasoline engines so if youre concerned about the environment a diesel vehicle might be a good choice for you,1
there are a few reasons why the federal reserve also known as the fed may not be able to lower interest rates below zeropractical considerations one practical issue with setting negative interest rates is that it becomes more attractive for people to hold cash instead of keeping their money in a bank account this could lead to a run on the banks as people try to withdraw their money which could destabilize the financial systemeconomic considerations negative interest rates can also create economic disincentives such as discouraging borrowing and lending this can lead to a slowdown in economic activity and potentially contribute to deflation which is a decrease in the general price level of goods and servicespsychological considerations negative interest rates may also have psychological effects on people and businesses as they may perceive negative rates as a sign of economic distress or a lack of confidence in the financial system this could lead to a decrease in consumer and business spending which could further weaken economic activityoverall while negative interest rates have been used by some central banks as a tool to stimulate economic activity there are significant limitations to their effectiveness and potential unintended consequences,1

an elementary  non biologist answer  while we sleep our mouths are nt generally open or taking in any food  because of the lack gases   oxygen   liquids  and solids  our mouths essentially become a breeding ground for bacteria and germs that cause bad breath  saliva is the number one warrior against bacteria  when we sleep  the lack of saliva produced allows the bacteria in our mouths to poop on our teeth and all inside our mouths all night  that s why we wake up with the slimy mouth and rancid breath  when you think about everything we eat  our mouth is a breeding ground for bacteria  throughout the day  the bacteria gets neutralized by our saliva  which is one of the main functions of saliva  besides lubrication  and the food and water that we eat and drink washes it into our stomach were the stomach acids neutralize and kill it  when we sleep  since there s no  washing down  mechanism  the bacteria just sits in our mouth and festers  the dieing bacteria and the bacteria leftovers  the  corpses  as well as the waste generated by it  is what causes the bad breath we all love waking up to in the mornings ,0
the key to understanding the aristocrats  which penguinkenny describes accurately  is that the humour does nt lie in the punchline  like with most jokes  the aristocrats is more like performance art  the point is to make the second part so drawn out and over  the  top in its offensiveness that your audience is left to feel uncomfortable and out of place  the punchline itself  the aristocrats   is more like the signal that you re done than the point of the joke  the humour is in the turning of the joke format on the head  than a punchline  based pay  off  it s more of an anti  joke  that is intended to shock an audience  it has 3 key elements  1  the setup  in which a family goes to a talent agent  2  the act  which consists of whatever the comedian wishes  usually it will include rape  child sexual abuse  sex with animals  various sex and other taboo acts  3  the punch line  where the horrified talent agent asks what the act is called  and the family reply   the aristocrats   it is nt funny because it s funny  it s funny because it s the exact opposite of funny  imagine it this way  you ve been watching two slugs trying to fuck in a teflon pan for an hour  they re slipping and sliding everywhere and just ca nt seem to get together  just as the slugs are about to get close  something always happens to make them slip away from each other  this is funny to you  but you ca nt wait for them to finally get to the fucking  after the long  drawn out process of them trying to bang  they finally get to it and just as that one gelatinous slimeball is about to slide his slippery little cock hammer into his mate s yearning  eager slime drain  boom the raptor you did nt even know was there guts you from the side ,0

suppose you wanted to draw a solid square on paper but you only have rubber stamps of circles  how do you do draw a square  you can use the biggest circle stamp  call it  size 10   to make one big circle  then stamp a smaller  size 5  circle four times around the big circle  then use progressively smaller circle stamps to fill in the gaps until you have a solid square  as you can imagine you d be using the smallest circle stamp   size 1   a lot to fill in the small white spaces at the sharp corners of the square  now suppose you needed a shorthand notation to describe this to another stamp artist how you drew a square using only circle stamps  1 square  1 size10  4 size5  16 size3  86 size2  158 size1 why is this useful  in the world of electronics and signals it s almost as if you re trying to communicate information using only one type of rubber stamp  the sine wave  the fourier series allows you to express and communicate arbitrary information using the the rubber circle stamp of the electronics world  the sine wave  added bonus  once information is translated into a sum of sine waves it can be transmitted  stored  and processed very easily  in fact you can use this for compression  suppose you do nt need to draw a perfect square  an approximate square would be good enough  then you can transmit less information  1 square  1 size10  4 size5  16 size3 it s a lumpy square but good enough  this is basis for jpeg and mpg signal compression  it translates the data into a wave  expresses that wave an approximate sum of sine waves  some of the fine detail information is lost  the information about how to reconstruct the signal is what is stored and transmitted  but overall our eyes and ears do nt notice that fine detail that was lost  this may be li4  but  say you want to make 11  but you only have a 4s and 1s  you would take two 4s and three 1s and add them together  right  now say you have a crazy function  curvy line on a graph   that s your  11   it turns out that you can take a bunch of sine and cosine functions  these are your 4s and 1s   and add them together just like we did with the 4s and 1s to get your curvy line  a little more complex  constructing a given function  your curvy line  takes a precise combination of the right sine and cosine functions  and just like we took   two   4s and   three   1s  we add those sines and cosines with different  weights  or  coefficients   say the given function is more like sinx  than cosx   we will add a large sinx  to a small cosx   li12 version  a fourier series is a way to break down a periodic shape as a sum of more basic components  think of some random periodic function as a cookie  it s really made up of ingredients like flour  butter  sugar  etc  you could write an equation like cookies   cups x flour   tbsps x butter   cups x sugar   for all the ingredients  for any periodic  endlessly repeating  function  we can break it up into the most bare bones periodic functions  which are sines and cosines  these look just like waves in a pool or on a string  the equation looks like complex shape   x cosine      x sine      x cosine2 x     the  just stands for some number that is nt important  the important part is that by adding together these very simple functions  cosine and sine are the simplest possible periodic functions   any function can be recreated  the more terms that are used  the better the approximation  in the same fashion of decomposing into fundamental building blocks  a fourier transform takes some complex signal and rewrites it in terms of the frequencies that make it up  take a complex musical note for example  if you play a chord on a guitar  all you hear is the signal sound generated  but that sound is made up of a number of different strings playing notes at different frequencies all melding together  a transform allows you to go back and forth between thinking about the note as a single complex note or as a number of very simple ones at different frequencies ,0
it is a brand name that ibm is applying to a large number of artificial intelligence  machine learning  and pattern recognition technologies  including the software  hardware  and services involved in doing so  originally  it was announced as the machine that could be humans an jeopardy  but it s really a big collection of technologies  watson is an ai designed by ibm to play jeopardy   jeopardy is a notoriously difficult game for ais  because jeopordy  poses the challenges as answers  from which one must derive the question  watson was really good at it and won  watson is still important because extrapolating questions from answers is not an easy task  but it is applicable for a lot of different fields  for instance  watson has been used for medical diagnoses due to its ability at linking queries and answers  both u  concisepirate and u  connor24601 are correct somewhat  originally ibm wanted to see if they could build a machine that is able to understand unstructured data as a human would  in other words  understand the intricacies of language that simple parsing engines are unable to  the example normally given is  fly over the boat with the red bow  to a human this is relatively easy to parse  it means a plane flying over a boat that has the bow of the ship coloured red  to a computer  fly  could mean house  fly   red bow  could refer to a hair ribbon that the fly is wearing  or it could refer to a house  fly holding a bow and arrow  once it could understand what the person meant  it was able to take action on that passage of text  in the original case  this was to find a question to an answer  then test if what it thought was right was correct  it would test itself   and then buzz in on the quiz show  one bit people tend to miss it that watson was also trained in game theory for the quiz  so it would sometimes buzz in  even if it was nt sure or did nt know the answer  to prevent others from getting it  there are more in depth details on ieee  url0  so after watson on jeopardy beat the world champions  ibm thought of ways to productise it  initially it went into the medical business  helping doctors  outside of that  two non  medical spin offs were watson discovery advisor and watson engagement advisor  wda was similar to a search engine  except that it could make connections you would not normally get in a search engine  and show exact evidence to why it picked an exact answer  it also had a cool feature you could give it a question and answer  and it would try to find evidence to link both  watson engagement advisor on the other hand was closer to jeopardy  it was designed to understand questions people have who may not know what they are looking for  for example  imagine your car is acting weird  you open the engine to find a red wire hanging off to the side  you do nt know what it does  and searching for  red wire  is not only not going to give good results  but you would have 100 s of things to read through  then if you go to a mechanic and tell them what you saw  they can normally tell you what s wrong  that s because not only have they been trained on the material  but they are also able to make the connection of your  non  mechanic  speak to their knowledge  this is what wea did  it later got added a component to deal with conversation beyond simple question and answer   now while these worked great  at the time they required a lot of resources and highly technical people to understand and train them  the other part to this was that there are a number of products that ibm were working on which fall under this  cognitive  grouping  for example understanding cooking  speech  pictures  emotion and tone  so there was a move to making watson accessible on the cloud by anyone  which is now on bluemix   watson became more of a brand for these kinds of product services  they are also greatly simplified to use  there is still the same complexity  but it is hidden away and the systems do most of the heavy lifting  i do nt want to turn this into an advert   but there is now a huge range of watson related products doing various different things ,0
and why is it only the top of their heads  how do they still have beards and other body hair  the reason is nt because there is something  good  about being bald  it s because there is nt anything that s necessarily  bad  about balding  especially when you re older  in terms of evolution  for the majority of human history  we did nt live very long  most guys died before they had a chance to go bald  and even if they did nt they would have already mated and passed on their genes by that time  so there was no way or reason to select against baldness genes  nowadays we live longer  but would nt you know it even though we usually make it far enough to start going bald  we also still usually have mated by then  that is nt to say that baldness is a sexual non  starter to all women  a full head of hair is a sign of virility to some  but most modern societies do nt consider it a non  starter because we value other aspects of people  i am not sure what the modern answer is  but up until at least early modern europe  1500  1700  it was believed that men went bald because they had hotter bodies than women  and so they burned up their own hair from the inside  that s wrong  of course  but it s a neat fact to tide you over until someone else can come along and give you a more scientific answer ,0
purchasing a property that already has tenants can present some risks and challenges but it can also offer potential benefits here are a few factors to considerrent income if the property comes with tenants it can provide a steady stream of rental income which can help offset some of the costs of owning the property however its important to be aware that tenants may move out or stop paying rent for various reasons which could disrupt the income streamtenant relationships if the previous owner had a good relationship with the tenants it can be helpful to maintain that relationship and continue providing a good living experience for the tenants however if the relationship was strained or there are issues with the property you may need to invest time and resources into resolving those issues and improving the tenant experiencemaintenance and repairs if the property is wellmaintained and in good condition it may be less risky to purchase however if the property requires significant repairs or updates you may need to invest more time and money into the property to make it suitable for tenantsoverall purchasing a property that comes with tenants can be a good investment if you are prepared to manage the risks and challenges and if you are able to provide a good living experience for the tenants its important to do your due diligence and carefully assess the property and the tenants before making a decision purchasing a property that already has tenants can be somewhat of a risk as the financial stability and behavior of the tenants may affect the success of the investment however it can also be a more secure investment because the property is already generating incomehere are some potential risks to consider when buying a property with tenantsthe tenants may not be reliable in paying rent on time which can impact your cash flowthe tenants may not take care of the property and cause damage which could result in costly repairsthe tenants may not be willing to vacate the property when you want to sell which could make it more difficult to sell the propertyon the other hand purchasing a property with tenants can also offer some benefitsthe property is already generating income which can provide a steady stream of cash flowthe tenants may have signed a longterm lease providing a measure of security for the investorits important to carefully consider the risks and benefits of purchasing a property with tenants before making a decision you may want to conduct thorough research on the financial stability and behavior of the tenants as well as the overall condition of the property it may also be helpful to seek the advice of a real estate professional or financial advisor,1

alright  my understanding is  1  there was a dictator called mubarak who everyone hated and they overthrew 2  he was replaced by morsi in a democratic election 3  he was doing a good job from the view of his backers  who are the muslim brotherhood  conservative muslims  4  others hated him because of a lack of progress  a lack of arrests from criminals during the mubarak reign  and a general slant towards conservative islam 5  those who hated him were making the country not work by strikes  protests  so the military backed them and arrested morsi 6  an interim president  the chief judge of their highest court  was put in by the military 7  morsi s backers are pissed because their guy  who was democratically elected  was thrown out in a coup  and they are protesting it 8 military does nt like this  so is cracking down  and the muslim brotherhood are reacting  or they started it  depending on your view  morsi was elected democratically but sought to enshrine islamic law in the drafting of the new constitution in egypt  in november 2012  he made declarations immunizing his actions from legal challenges in egypt  tldr old president morsi was elected but acted like dictator  his supporters are fighting with everyone else  what s going on is a power struggle between two groups  1  the military  who has run the country since the 1950s and is generally very well  liked by the egyptian people  2  the muslim brotherhood  who have been operating in the country since the 1930s trying to establish an islamist government  one who governs according to the principles of islam  and enjoy a fair amount of support  now  the military has been oppressing the muslim brotherhood for the better part of a century  let s just say old habits die hard  dictator hosni mubarak was removed in 2011 by a popular revolt  supported by the muslim brotherhood  and eventually by the military also  they basically realized he was done and they would either go down with him or manage a transition to democracy where they were still in charge  this transition to democracy happened  sort of  they had free and fair elections  and to the military s dismay the muslim brotherhood was elected  not a huge surprise considering they have a lot of popular support and they were the only opposition who was organized before this all happened  so muhammed morsi takes the reigns  now remember  the mb have wanted this for like 70 years  he goes about trying to make the islamist country they ve envisioned  against the wishes of a fair chunk of the population  he also behaves like a dictator  imprisoning opposition members and trying to consolidate his power to ensure the mb will run the place for a long time  so the military kicks him out with the support of basically all the non  mb egyptians  and takes the reigns again  now they are basically making sure the muslim brotherhood is never going to run the show again ,0
government bond yields also known as treasury yields refer to the interest rate that the government pays to borrow money from investors these yields can vary for a number of reasons includinginflation expectations if investors expect that the price of goods and services will increase rapidly in the future they may demand a higher interest rate to compensate for the expected erosion of purchasing power as a result the government may have to pay a higher yield on its bonds to attract buyerseconomic conditions in general investors tend to demand higher yields on government bonds when the economy is growing rapidly and inflation is expected to rise on the other hand in times of economic uncertainty or recession investors may be willing to accept lower yields in exchange for the perceived safety and stability of government bondscentral bank policies central banks such as the federal reserve in the united states can influence government bond yields through their monetary policies for example if the central bank raises interest rates it can cause yields on government bonds to rise as wellpolitical risk investors may also take into account the stability and reliability of the government issuing the bond when determining the yield they are willing to accept if there is a perceived risk that the government may default on its debt investors may demand a higher yield as compensation for the added risksupply and demand like any other financial asset the price and yield of government bonds are influenced by the supply of bonds available and the demand for them if there is a high demand for government bonds the price may rise and the yield may fall conversely if there is a surplus of bonds and not enough demand the price may fall and the yield may rise,1
fatty foods are high in calories  you need alot of calories to survive  you need relatively few vitamins to survive  keep in mind that agriculture and all of recorded history are a drop in the bucket compared to the age of our species  we ve only been farming about 12 thousand years  but have anatomically modern humans for about 200 thousand  for the first 94  of human history  plus the millions of years before we could be called human   we lived as nomad hunters and gatherers  and having enough food to simply stay alive was among our highest priorities  in that context  it makes perfect sense that energy  dense high fat and high sugar foods would be more appealing  since every calorie mattered  what happened since then is as we got smarter we learned how to create an excess of food  the complete opposite of what we evolved to deal with  so it should be no surprise that the same traits that kept us alive now give us unique problems in our new environment  taste buds  did  evolve to eat the most healthy food  but then the rules changed about what was healthy  before civilization  food was scarce  and most human lived not too far away from starvation  the most important form of nutrition was calories  so if you had a choice been a honeycomb and a turnip  the honeycomb is way better for you  but it was also rare enough that a lot of the time  you had to make due with the turnip  then humans invented ways to make food plentiful  and could eat all the sugar they wanted  this was so recent  in evolutionary turns  that our biology has nt caught up yet ,0
a data mart is a structureaccess pattern specific to data warehouse environments used to retrieve clientfacing data the data mart is a subset of the data warehouse and is usually oriented to a specific business line or team whereas data warehouses have an enterprisewide depth the information in data marts pertains to a single department in some deployments each department or business unit is considered the owner of its data mart including all the hardware software and data  this enables each department to isolate the use manipulation and development of their data in other deployments where conformed dimensions are used this business unit owner will not hold true for shared dimensions like customer product etcnwarehouses and data marts are built because the information in the database is not organized in a way that makes it readily accessible this organization requires queries that are too complicated difficult to access or resource intensivenwhile transactional databases are designed to be updated data warehouses or marts are read only data warehouses are designed to access large groups of related records data marts improve enduser response time by allowing users to have access to the specific type of data they need to view most often by providing the data in a way that supports the collective view of a group of usersna data mart is basically a condensed and more focused version of a data warehouse that reflects the regulations and process specifications of each business unit within an organization each data mart is dedicated to a specific business function or region this subset of data may span across many or all of an enterprises functional subject areas it is common for multiple data marts to be used in order to serve the needs of each individual business unit different data marts can be used to obtain specific information for various enterprise departments such as accounting marketing sales etcnthe related term spreadmart is a pejorative describing the situation that occurs when one or more business analysts develop a system of linked spreadsheets to perform a business analysis then grow it to a size and degree of complexity that makes it nearly impossible to maintain the term for this condition is excel hell,0

the way these fast food items are created is specific to what humans crave  certain amount of salt here  certain amount of sugar there and you create a taste that taps into and exploits what humans already naturally crave  for example  the way candy mimics the appeal of fruit and then exploits it  fruit used to be our candy  why do nt we eat less sugar  because it s addicting  sugar has the same affect on the brain as cocain and well  the case makes itself  the same can be applied to fast food  it s biology vs you  our ancestors were programmed to see sugary fatty food as an excellent resource  they did nt have a steady food source  so finding these was like finding gold  now  you still have that genetic code  you know it s bad for you  but chemicals in your brain are compromising your thought  think of it like nicotine  we know it s bad but ca nt help it physically  why do you think  what does fast food taste like  and how des it compare to a salad or an apple ,0

the aristocrats joke is a joke that has been told by comedians for many years it is not appropriate for children and is not meant to be taken seriouslynnthe joke typically starts with a person asking another person to tell a joke and the person being asked responds by saying i have a joke called the aristocrats the person asking then says okay go ahead and tell itnnthe person telling the joke then proceeds to describe a family usually called the aristocrats who are involved in a series of outrageous disgusting and inappropriate behaviors these behaviors might include things like sexual acts bodily functions and violence the punchline of the joke is that the family is called the aristocrats which is meant to be a play on words as the word aristocrat usually refers to a person of high social standing or noble birthnnthe joke is not meant to be funny because of the content of the joke itself but rather because of the absurdity of the situation and the use of the word aristocrats to describe such an outrageous and inappropriate family the joke is often told in a very deadpan matteroffact way which can also contribute to the humornnit is important to note that the aristocrats joke is not appropriate for all audiences and should only be told to adults who are comfortable with offensive and inappropriate material,1

when you develop a romanization system  often the language does nt use the sound a letter usually makes  but has a sound that the alphabet does nt have a single letter for by default  so you repurpose the letter  similarly  many first nations languages  writing systems indicate vowel length with a dot before or after the character  but use vowel doubling when writing in the latin alphabet  ching is not spelled xing in chinese  it s spelled qing  the reason they do nt spell it ching is because it s not pronounced ching  in fact there is nt a  ching  in mandarin chinese  qing is very close to but not the same as ching sound  there are sounds in chinese that do nt have an exact equivalent in roman letters or with an english pronunciation  there have been many ways to deal with it  the  xing  sound in your example  pronounced more like  shing   is a pretty easy one to start with  it s a shhh sound  but with a different mouth shape from sh  which also exists in chinese  how do you conveniently differentiate from the two sounds  when they d both be  sh  in english  at least   an earlier phoneticization  wade  giles  used  hs   yale romanization uses  sy   the official pinyin romanization is  x  none are perfect  but you have to choose between imperfect systems ,0
alcoholic beverages such as beer wine and spirits are not required to have nutrition labels because they are not considered to be a significant source of nutrition instead they are considered to be beverages that are consumed for their taste texture and alcoholic content nutrition labels are typically required on food products that are intended to provide nutrients to the body such as vitamins minerals and protein alcoholic beverages do not provide these nutrients in the same way that food does and therefore are not required to have nutrition labels however some alcoholic beverages such as wine may include a nutrition label that lists the number of calories carbohydrates and other nutrients that are present in a serving of the product this information is typically included as a matter of convenience for consumers who are interested in tracking their intake of these nutrients however this information is not required by law and not all alcoholic beverages include it,1
in the united states the president is not elected directly by the people instead the president is elected by something called the electoral collegenneach state gets a certain number of electors based on its population the number of electors a state gets is equal to the number of representatives it has in congress which is based on population for example a state with a larger population will get more electors than a state with a smaller populationnnto win the presidency a candidate needs to get at least 270 electoral votes this means they need to win the support of a majority of the electorsnnsometimes the candidate who gets the most votes from the people also known as the popular vote does not win the electoral college this can happen if the candidate who wins the popular vote does not win enough states to get 270 electoral votesnnfor example in the 2000 presidential election al gore won the popular vote but george w bush won the electoral college and therefore became president this happened because bush won more states and therefore had more electoral votes even though gore had more votes from individual peoplenni hope this helps let me know if you have any other questions,1

i really doubt this is safe in any way  but a person who has had this done would still be able to be detected through a breathalyzer for the same reasons that eating a bunch of mints or scrubbing your mouth clean does nt get you out of a breathalyzer test  the reason people get caught is because they think the alcohol is what s left over in their mouth  but it is nt  it s the alcohol that exists in the blood which is currently being filtered through their lungs  their bac  blood alcohol content  is not going to change if your mouth is completely clear of any trace of alcohol  because when you breathe into a breathalyzer you have to take a deep breath  so the air gets stored in your lungs  and gets mixed with your alcohol  saturated blood  so you re still discovered  in this case  injecting it directly avoids the mouth  but since the mouth is nt really relevant at all  i m sure a person would register a similar bac on a breathalyzer anyway  assuming they did nt die from injecting themselves like an idiot  recovering addict here  i used to shoot jagermeister mixed w dope  motley crue used to do it as well  do nt know about smelling it on your breath  but you can definitely taste the alcohol  ethanol iv is occasionally used as an antidote to methanol poisoning as your body s enzymes responsible for the metabolism of the methanol to the toxic formic acid have a higher affinity to the ethanol  i ve also heard of it being used to treat several alcohol withdrawal  ie  wean them slowly off it  but i ve never witnessed it myself in this context  and you would still fail a breathalyzer because it s the metabolism  excretion via your lungs that is the source of the measurement  i ve treated patients for withdrawal that tried to hide their use from family or whomever via taking it rectally as well  source  i m an inner  city icu nurse,0
russia is so big because it is located in both europe and asia and spans a very large area it is the largest country in the world by land area and it stretches from the eastern part of europe all the way to the far east of asia this makes it very diverse with different regions having different climates landscapes and cultures despite this diversity russia has been able to hold together as a country because of its strong central government and its shared history and culture the people of russia also have a strong sense of national identity and pride in their country which helps to keep the country united,1
bass and treble are two different ranges of sound frequencies that make up music bass refers to the lower frequencies which are typically associated with a deeper fuller sound treble refers to the higher frequencies which are typically associated with a brighter more resonant soundnnan equalizer is a tool that allows you to adjust the balance of these different frequency ranges in your music it usually has a number of different bands that you can adjust each of which controls a different range of frequencies for example you might have a band that controls the bass frequencies a band that controls the midrange frequencies and a band that controls the treble frequenciesnnto get the optimum effect with your equalizer youll want to find a balance that sounds good to you this will depend on your personal preferences and the type of music youre listening to some people like a lot of bass while others prefer a more balanced sound experiment with adjusting the different bands and see what works best for you you can also try using a preset equalizer setting thats designed for the type of music youre listening to such as rock or jazz,1
segregation was a system of separating people based on their race in the american south segregation was used to discriminate against black people and maintain white supremacythere were many ways that segregation was justified by its supporters some argued that segregation was necessary to keep the races separate but equal they believed that black people and white people were inherently different and needed to be kept separate in order to avoid conflict and to ensure that each group had equal access to resourcesother supporters of segregation argued that it was necessary to maintain the purity of the white race they believed that mixing with black people or other people of color would pollute the white race and lead to the decline of white societystill others argued that segregation was natural and godgiven they believed that it was simply the way things were meant to be and that it was not up to humans to try to change itoverall segregation was used as a way to justify the unequal treatment of black people and maintain white dominance in society it was wrong because it denied people of color equal rights and opportunities and it was based on the false belief that one race is superior to another,1

i think youre right that from a pure expected future value perspective it makes sense to pay this loan off as quickly as possible including not taking the next years loan the new student loans with the higher interest rates have changed the balance enough that its no longer automatically better to keep it going as long as possible the crucial point in your case which isnt true for many people is that you will likely have to pay it off eventually anyway and so in terms of net costs over your lifetime you will do best by paying it off quickly a few points to set against that that you might want to consider not paying it off is a good hedge against your career not going as well as you expect eg if the economy does badly you have health problems you take a career break for any reason if that happens you would end up not being forced to pay it off so will end up gaining from not having done so voluntarily the money you save in that case could be more valuable to you that the money you would lose if your career does go well not paying it off will increase your net cash earlier in life when you are more likely to need it eg for a house deposit having more free cash could increase your options making it possible to buy a house earlier in life or it could mean you have a higher deposit when you do buy reducing the interest rate on the entire mortgage balance the savings from that could end up being more than the 6 interest on the loan even though when you look at the loan in isolation it seems like a very bad rate,0
the mormon church also known as the church of jesus christ of latterday saints was founded in the early 1800s by a man named joseph smith joseph smith claimed that he had been visited by god and jesus christ and that they had given him a special mission to restore the true christian church on the earthnnaccording to the story joseph smith was told by an angel named moroni that there was a set of golden plates hidden in a hill near his home in new york the plates contained the writings of an ancient prophet named mormon who had lived in the americas thousands of years ago joseph smith was given the power to translate the writings on the plates into english and this translation became the book of mormonnnthe book of mormon teaches that jesus christ visited the americas after his resurrection and taught the people there about his gospel it also contains the teachings and commandments of god for the people living in the americas at that timennthe mormon church believes that the teachings in the book of mormon along with the bible are the word of god and are important for guiding their lives and helping them to follow jesus christnnas for the hat there is no specific reference to a hat in the history of the mormon church it is possible that you may be thinking of the special garments that some members of the mormon church wear as a reminder of their commitment to god and as a protection from temptation these garments include a top and bottom piece but they do not include a hat,1

mitt romney is a politician who was a candidate for president of the united states in 2012 as part of the election process candidates are often asked to release their tax returns which are documents that show how much money they earned and how much they paid in taxes people care about a candidates tax returns because they want to know how much money the candidate makes and how they have paid their taxes mitt romney paid a lot in taxes because he made a lot of money in 2012 he earned millions of dollars from his work as a businessman and investor when you make a lot of money you generally have to pay more in taxes because the government uses your tax dollars to pay for things like schools roads and hospitals an average american pays taxes too but they probably dont make as much money as mitt romney did this means they might not have to pay as much in taxes as he did the amount of taxes someone has to pay depends on how much money they make and other factors like whether they are married or have children in general people care about a candidates tax returns because they want to know if the candidate is paying their fair share of taxes and using their money responsibly they might also be interested in learning more about a candidates financial situation and whether they have any conflicts of interest that could influence their decisions as a politician,1
believe it or not  by physically cutting and splicing segments of actual film  it was absurdly time consuming and complicated  the editing was splicing and cutting actual film and of course the problem with working with film is that you ca nt see the footage as easily as you can today  all film reels had 12 minutes of footage  so when you popped a film reel into a camera you had 12 minutes of footage  when that ran out you popped in another film reel  because of this directors had to be super organized to make sure they did nt waste film because 35 mm film is really expensive  this is nt the case with new cameras as everything is digital and stored on card or hard drives  when they filmed a scene they could nt really see if the shot was good or not afterwards because it was film  the film had to be processed in order to view it  so after a weeks filming all the important people would go into a theater and watch all the  dailies   that s every scene shot from the week  they would pick out which scenes are good and which are nt  they would know from this which scenes were fuck ups and note it down to save time in editing  that s why they have the clipper board at the beginning of every scene  the green screen was done by not using green screen because there were no computers but by actual people painting photo realistic backgrounds  the old days they painted massive backgrounds on set  after a while they figured out they could project the necessary scene from film onto a smaller size screen and paint the background where it needed to be painted and somehow composite the background onto a new film reel along with the original footage  if you watch the first batman movie this was the technique used  everything was filmed on set or a studio lot and all the backgrounds  the bat cave etc  were paintings composited onto the film frame  because all of these old movies were filmed on film  this is the reason we can watch them in 1080p  blu ray  for the first time is history i can watch et in it s highest resolution to date apart from the first time it was shown in cinemas  the reason this is because film is optical and not digital  the lens narrowed the light onto a piece of film and chemically changed it to capture whatever light was coming through the lens  this can be projected with light again to a massive screen and holds massive amounts of detail and the  resolution can hold more than 1080p  however when you watch et it is sharper but still does nt look like present day sharpness  it just has an 80 s feel to the footage  this is not because of the age of the original film  it may have an effect  but it s actually the lens used  the lenses back then are nt as sharp as they are now and that is why et wo nt be 1080p digital sharp like todays cameras  the lens actually added a characteristic to the footage  if you want to recreate an 80 s movie the trick is not to use special effects but to actually use an 80 s lens on a brand new camera  so because of the new lenses of today the et blu  ray may actually be the sharpest version every seen by anyone ever  even more sharper than the original cinema release because the cinema projector lens was nt as sharp  if steven spielberg had today s lenses back then et would be as sharp as movies are today  films were made on  actual  really  real film  much like the stuff you used to put into a point  and  shoot camerahere s a good bit  referencing the star wars restoration   url1   when you want an edit you had to take the physical film  cut it  paste  tape it together with the other part you want to edit in  and  viola  you have an edit  hence the term   ending up on the cutting room floor   url0    when editing a movie in computers  you do copying and pasting and overlaying and manipulating things frame  by  frame  people did that with physical copies of the film  this sometimes introduced dust and scratches  and due to limitations of the technology  things happen like where the cockpit structure of a snowspeeder in empire strikes back looks partly transparent due to limitations of the processing  you can also see some of those effects in simple things  watch an old movie where there s a dissolve or wipe  right before the effect happens  there s a nearly  invisible edit where they spliced in the  effect   but you can tell something happened because there s a slight change in the contrast or brightness of the image versus immediately before the transition started  these were done with something called an  optical printer   url2   which is sort of like multiple projectors projecting on a screen  while another camera films it  this is how overlays  changes  matte paintings  and other effects were accomplished for many years  it was done by manipulating really  real physical film  copies of the original negative that went through the camera  as for sound  film audio is almost always an entirely separate process from film editing  up until the master print is made  before digital editing  tape was physically cut and taped together to make splices  too  other than when it was mixed using a mixing board ,0

it does nt  it s not that wider wheels have better grip  but that wheels with better grip are made wider  soft compound tyres are required to be wider in order for the side  wall to support the weight of the car  softer tyres have a larger coefficient of friction  therefore better traction  a narrow  soft tyre would not be strong enough  nor would it last very long  since the rate of wear is inversely proportional to the contact area  harder compound tyres wear much longer  and can be narrower  they do  however have a lower coefficient of friction  therefore less traction  among tyres of the same type and composition  here is no appreciable difference in  traction  with different widths  wider tires  assuming all other factors are equal  commonly have stiffer side  walls and experience less roll  this gives better cornering performance  the simplified friction model claims that friction is nt influenced by surface area  but it is only a simplified model which can not be applied to all cases  when studying the subject more  you ll find out that friction coefficient is nt that constant  soft rubber is able to sink a bit between grains of asphalt and get better grip  bigger the area  more gaps and more grip  simple model  in which friction is nt altered by surface area works well in many cases and gives close enough estimates  it is also much easier to understand  if you re studying something  in which friction plays larger role  more is taught on a subject  in my case i learned the ugly  it sorta depends and you may need to form your own model for that case  truth in mechanical engineering studies in university  because friction and traction are different things  friction is resistant to movement  traction is the ability to generate motion between a body and a surface  they are related  but they are not the same thing  traction also involves the shear strength of the substances involved  imagine a car with studded tires driving on ice  the friction is the same  but the studs are penetrating the ice and pushing against it  giving better traction ,0
in general using less leverage or borrowing a smaller proportion of the purchase price of a rental property will typically result in a lower return on investment this is because using less leverage means that you are investing a larger proportion of your own capital in the property which reduces the potential return on that investmenthowever there may be certain circumstances in which using less leverage could result in a better return on a rental property for example if you are able to secure a very low interest rate on a mortgage using less leverage could potentially result in a higher return since the cost of borrowing would be lower additionally if you are able to negotiate a favorable purchase price for the property using less leverage could also potentially result in a higher return since the overall cost of the property would be lowerits also important to consider the risks associated with using more leverage using more leverage increases the risk of default since a larger proportion of the purchase price is financed with debt if the property does not generate enough income to cover the costs of the mortgage taxes and other expenses you could potentially lose your investment using less leverage can help to reduce this risk,1
ely10  you re    30 times   more likely to laugh in social settings   url0  compared to when you re alone  the laugh track or  sweetening  is an effective  enough simulacrum of a social setting that you re more likely to laugh at sweetened stuff  ely5  you laugh more when you re with other people  and the laugh track is like having a bunch of really laugh  y friends around  bonus  tv executives who make final programming decisions are not comedians  writers  or other performing types  they re business guys  the laugh track tells them where the hee  larious comedy is in a show  and if those guys need it  they figure everybody does  watch some clips of big bang theory without it  the show is dead in the water without people telling you when to laugh   here ya go   url0  interesting fact that i ca nt substantiate because i ca nt remember where i read it  most of the canned laughter you hear on sitcoms was recorded in the 1950s and just gets repeated over and over  so the people you hear laughing in current sitcoms are either very old  or  by now have passed away  i guess laughter never changes ,0
the part that makes people allergic to cats is actually a protein  fel d1  found in their saliva  when a cat licks herself  she deposits the protein on her skin  and when it dries off  the flakes become airborne and trigger symptoms of allergy in people  so  it s not the fur that s the issue  it s the dead skin  in short  there s no cat that s 100  hypoallergenic  they can only produce less of the protein fel d1 than regular cats  some cats tend to be preferred because of trial and error  and even then  some of the most likely to not cause allergies still do because maintenance is required  like bathing or brushing  to make those pets optimal  no animal is truly hypoallergenic  it all depends on what exactly  saliva  dander  fur  has the most protein and how much the animal s activities put those things into the air  this will determine how sensitive the allergic person is to the animal  even so  called  hypoallergenic  breeds  those who do nt shed or whatever criteria are used  may elicit a serious reaction and other breeds or individual animals may not  this is why an allergic person even considering adopting or purchasing an animal should meet the individual animal first and observe reactions  my son is dog allergic but reacted horribly to a shih  tzu  a  hypoallergenic  breed  we were considering buying  but reacted not at all to our rat terrier mix  nothing is more important when looking at individual allergies than examining the individual animal  biologically and structurally there is no difference between hair and fur  both are a outgrowth of a protein called keratin  which also makes up things like nails and claws  fur is used to describe animal with thick coats  eg dogs  bears  cats  rabbits   hair is usually reserved to describe animals with thin  sparse coats  eg humans  hippos  elephants  manatees  ,0
cgi in movies and video games are created using similar techniques but there are a few key differences that can affect their realism one reason that cgi in movies might look more realistic is that it is often created at a higher resolution than cgi in video games this means that the images in movies have more detail and are clearer which can make them look more lifelike another reason is that movies often have a larger budget for cgi than video games which means that the artists working on the cgi have more time and resources to perfect the final product finally the way that cgi is used in movies and video games can also be different in movies cgi is often used to create entire worlds or characters that are not possible to create in the real world while in video games cgi is often used to enhance or augment realworld environments or characters,1
like having to piss  try to not piss  the need fills your mind  your body and mind ca nt ignore the building signal  there are two kinds of problems you get from addictions  the first one is the most common  and it s getting addicted to the feeling of something  with a drug  it s usually because taking the drug makes you feel happy  or calm  or at the very least  you do nt feel sad anymore  it s fulfilling in some way  like eating delicious food or having really good sex  when you grow dependent  you start to rely on the drug because you get used to feeling happy  or used to being able to run away from your sadness so easily  it s like a quick fix  why bother cooking a whole meal when you can just order a delicious pizza  sometimes  knowing you have a problem can make you even more dependent  because you can just take the drug to stop feeling sad about it  other times  if you stop taking a drug  you just crave it the way you crave air when you hold your breath  it does nt feel especially good to breathe  but you always notice how much you hate not breathing  then there s withdrawal  unlike psychological addiction  which is liking the feeling of taking the drug  withdrawal keeps you addicted because stopping feels awful  some withdrawals make you really sad  some make you sick  some are painful  some withdrawals can kill you  cigarettes are tough to quit because even though they do nt make you feel really good compared to most other drugs  they make you crave smoking just so that you can feel normal again  the withdrawal from cigarettes makes you really irritable and upset  but above all  you should remember to be supportive of your so  the only thing harder than quitting is quitting alone  i think the best way for me to characterise addiction came from 12 step programs  which i have mixed feelings about    an obsession of the mind and a compulsion of the body    this summarises both the psychological and physical addictions so succinctly  depending on the drug of choice  one of these two will probably come before the other  but both will inevitably happen if you keep on long enough  provided the drug has a potential for physical dependence   one is not inherently worse than the other  both have the potential to be sheer misery and living hell  247  there s no break or reprieve  i ve had physical withdrawals that put me in the hospital multiple times and very nearly killed me  but the anguish and mental prison that comes from psychological dependence can be just as crippling and deadly  for me  i was psychologically addicted first  i was a late bloomer  i never drank  used until relatively late in life  but as soon as i did  i was immediately hooked  i did nt party like normal people who went out on the weekends and had a few drinks and then resumed their lives as normal  it consumed my thoughts  i plotted and planned and when i was nt using  i was thinking about using  you know how you feel when you go to work and forget your phone at home   feel free to substitute any  vital  thing that you use daily  the internet  your purse  wallet  whatever   sure  you might not actually need your phone to call anyone  in fact  you kind of hate having to answer it all day long  all people do is bitch at you anyway  it s not worth it  but you spend all day at work sitting there obsessing about what important texts you re missing  your work suffers  you try to take a nap on your break and ca nt  you snap at everyone for no reason because your mind is elsewhere but you ca nt figure out exactly why you re irritated  on your way home  your phone is all you re thinking about  you can even visualise yourself holding it and turning it on  entering the screen lock code  checking your messages  you immediately check it first thing when you walk in the door and your anxiety and stress from the past 8 hours is finally relieved and you feel normal again  no missed calls or anything  there was no real reason to even worry  that s a very tame version of what it s like to be an addict   although for me  in active addiction this analogy would have made no sense  because a phone was useless  the bill was never paid anyway  i chose that analogy simply because i see so many people whining about lost  broken  forgotten phones as if it s the end of the world as they know it   using drugs and alcohol is nt even fun anymore  it provides us few benefits  in fact  the negative consequences vastly outweigh the positives  but we still continue to do it anyway and feel horrible when we are nt  then  if it progresses  the physical dependence sets in  now  you re not only  thinking  about your drug of choice  but your body is  constantly reminding you  that you   need this now    it s very difficult to concentrate on daily life when your brain is running a million miles a minute thinking about a substance  and then you start getting sick on top of it  so  you re trying to work  and not only are you anxious and worried  but you start shaking and puking uncontrollably  your heart races so fast you re seriously convinced that you re having a heart attack or stroke  this makes your anxiety even worse  unbearable  terrifying  you might end up calling emergency services because you legitimately think you re dying  only to find out it s another panic attack  everything part of your body hurts and you ca nt stay one temperature  you re either freezing or burning up  dripping with sweat  you smell disgusting no matter how many showers you take every day  at the bitter end of the scale  sleep is completely replaced with seizures and hallucinations  i do nt know what to compare that to except perhaps having a metal pole shoved through your head  you   know   that you should nt pull it out  but the pain is so bad and you re in such a frenzy that you re driven to do so anyway to relieve the pressure  so you yank it out and things feel better momentarily  likewise with serious addiction  continuing to use drugs is very likely an eventual death sentence  but whilst going through withdrawal  we do it anyway in because that moment of crisis  relief is more important and valuable than absolutely anything else in the world  at least it does nt feel like it  and you  know  that your drug of choice will provide that gratification  nothing logical matters now  we do nt even have the  capacity  to think logically at this instant  this is why  how addicts throw their lives away and lose everything that matters to them  anyway  a lot of that is way above and beyond what someone addicted to nicotine would experience  personally  i ve never really had tough withdrawals from cigarettes  i can either take them or leave them  one thing i have noticed  though  is that they re so ubiquitous that efforts to completely quit are easily abandoned  when i chose to stop shooting up dope and getting shitfaced drunk  it s not like i was going to walk down the street and see someone sipping on cheap vodka like it s sprite and then nonchalantly pulling out a syringe to shoot up at the bus stop outside my university   yes  this does happen  but let s be realistic  cigarettes are far more societally acceptable  not to mention legal   even when i m not really in the mood to smoke  if i hang out with people who smoke long enough  the temptation eventually arises  especially if smoking is  the  social activity like it is at some workplaces and such  it sounds so damn dumb when i type it out  when you get on a schedule of going outside  sitting down with your friends  watching them smoke  well  it does nt seem so bad to just have one  provided you re a smoker  former smoker  obviously   soon you re back to smoking when you re by yourself  walking to the bus stop  before you go to bed  whatever your little routines are  it kills time and it gets so ingrained into your mind that  that s what you re supposed to be doing right now   i find that the things that worked best for me were finding something else to occupy my time and distract myself  grab a book  listen to music  and put the  517 per pack in a savings account towards some luxury item i want  etc  i saw in another comment that you mentioned that he does nt want you to acknowledge his quitting  i   completely   sympathise with this point  when people make a big deal  or even a little deal  about my sobriety  it is obnoxious and a pain in the ass  it makes me feel like people are watching and waiting for me to fail  which just causes more anxiety  which very well could lead to me saying  fuck it  and going back to old habits  i relapse far more often when i m counting the days  i m a performance perfectionist  i compare myself to others  and it just makes me nervous to have an audience to my personal struggles  it s admirable that you want to help support him  but it may hinder more than you realise  especially in the first few days  weeks  months  if  anything   after he s done well for awhile  make a casual comment about it then to let him know you ve seen positive progress  other than that  i d let him tackle this one on his own ,0

your not really asleep  it s more of a loss of consciousness then the regular cycle you go through at night  while we have a decent idea of how anesthesia works the specifics are still a bit of a mystery  partly this has to do with our lack of understanding on the mind in general  whatever drug is being administered for the procedure being done is simply targeting certain parts of the brain  central nervous system and to a greater extent certain neurotransmitters like gaba  glutamate  serotonin  etc  depending on the action of the drug  we re either trying to inhibit or excite these neurotransmitters of the brain  of course i m oversimplifying this whole process  but it s been years since i ve taken a neuro course  my sister is an operating department practitioner and she told me that nobody actually knows  why  it works  pretty freaky,0
as an mma fighter  you can also fight on the ground  so falling can mean something different  if you do it right  you could possibly get the advantage  if you re talking about kos  it s all in the gloves  20 year veteran of various martial arts here  the answer is actually simple  it s all about distribution of force over surface area  so imagine placing a 50 lb bag of sand on your leg as you are sitting  no problem right  now imagine putting a chopstick on your leg vertically  and then putting the 50 lb bag of sand on top of it  that s gon na hurt to say the least  the same principle remains true for impacts to the face and head  boxing gloves distribute that force across a wide  flat surface  a bare knuckle punch concentrates that force into a far smaller surface area  in truly skilled fighters only the first and second knuckles make impact because they are directly aligned to the radius and ulner bones of the forearm  the ring finger and pinky have no such support and are far more likely to be damaged  getting hit with a punch focused down into two spots the size of dimes is going to seriously rattle hour skull in a way a boxing glove can not  stang back now  i m going to try science  so  one pascal  1 pa  is the pressurep  exerted by aforce  f  of one newton  1n  on a surface areaa  of one square metre1m2   so 32n against 1m2  32 pa  32 pascal s of force  in english that s 32 newtons pressing against a 1 square meter flat surface will produce 32 pascal s of force  the pascal s are what you  feel  when getting punched  but if you exert that same 32n against a larger surface area like say  4 meters squared  4m2  you only get 8 pa that s a big drop in power for going to four times the flat surface  in more relative terms to lunching  ask yourself how many dimes fit on the surface of a fist  vs how many on a boxing glove  whatever the difference is can then be calculated by using the above formula  my best guess is that a boxing glove spreads the force distribution far enough to reduce the pascal s delivered to somewhere between 14th to 16th of that delivered by a bare knuckle punch  same power  just spread out  tldr  a boxing glove distributes the force over a much larger surface  thereby reducing the amount of force every contacted square centimeter of your head has to absorb  50 pascal s distributed over 4 square centimeters will deliver a lot more force than if it s spread across 40 centimeters  i am pretty sure that wearing huge gloves with giant wads of padding on the knuckles is a way huger factor than you are giving it credit for ,0
well  usually benevolent   benign   tumors can be treated just by having them removed surgically  but in the case that the cancerous cells have already metastasized  this ca nt be done  metastasis is the process by which cancer cells detach from tumors in one part of the body and attach to other organs  once these malignant cells have detached from the original tumor  they are no longer isolated to one part of the body  so cutting out the original tumor may not completely remove the cancer  or at least  that s my understanding of it  i m no doctor  edit  meant to say benign  not benevolent  benevolent would imply that your tumor is  well meaning and kindly   which is probably is nt  it is very difficult to get a matching donor to start with due to major histocompatability differences  also the new organ will eventually be rejected by the body  as u  toolsofrage noted  organ transplants are extremely difficult  the human body s immune system is very finely tuned to detect and destroy foreign invaders like bacteria and viruses  but it can not distinguish between a harmful virus and a beneficial transplanted organ and will attack them both  transplant rejection is a huge concern  and the procedures to combat it  primarily  reducing the effectiveness of the immune system  can cause even worse complications  in most cancer situations  either only the affected  cancerous  part of the organ is removed  ie a lobectomy  like walter white had on  breaking bad    or an external mechanism is used to replace the removed organ  dialysis  for example   rather than a transplant ,0
because there are tons and tons of stars in the center of the galaxy  too  hundreds of millions of them  and supermassive black holes are still very small relative to that number of stars  for example  sagittarius a   which is the name of the black hole in the center of the galaxy  has a radius of 17 light  hours  which is 120 au  ie 120 times the distance from the earth to the sun   that s just a bit further than the current distance to the voyager 1 probe  so sagittarius a  is essentially the size of a solar system  surrounded by hundreds of millions of  actual solar systems   complete with stars  the reason you see the bright spot in the center is that the star density is much higher there  this means there is a much higher density of luminous matter there  and it is hence brighter than the rest of the galaxy  what you are saying about a super massive black hole is correct  but the thing about black holes is they tend to be smaller than most stars  even a super massive black hole would nt even be as big as our solar system  you just ca nt see it compared to the amount of light emitted from the centre is the galaxy  black holes can be amazingly bright  though not from light escaping from within them  obviously  they are believed to acquire an accretion disc around them rather as a sun does when it s forming  matter falling into the gravity well will get very hot  with large holes hot enough to shine brightly ,0

in a nutshell  the router is plugged into the internet and acts as the middle man between you and the web  say you go to url0  what s actually happening is your pc is sending a signal in the 23 ghz range with a message to the router  the router gets the message then fetches the website and sends the information back to you  computers beam out rays that are just like beams of light  except that they re invisible to our eyes  they can bounce off things a little better  and they sometimes can pass through thin walls  we call those rays  radio waves   those same waves are used for radios  cordless phones  computers  walkie  talkies and many other things  radio stations have to send sound miles away  so they use a giant antenna to send a lot of radio waves  that s like a giant flashlight  the computer s wifi only works for about the size of a house  so it only needs a tiny antenna  sometimes it s so small  the antenna totally fits inside the computer  you can imagine sending a message to someone far away using a flashlight  one way to do that is by turning it on and off in a code  like morse code  instead of turning it on and off  you could also change the color of the light to send a message  computers can do the same thing to radio waves  even though they re invisible  they can be changed just the same way light can change color  they change the color of the radio waves very  very quickly using a code that other computers and your wifi hub can understand  i works in a very similar way to radio or tv  when your wifi enabled computer requests a webpage  the wifi card  which is a radio transmitter  receiver  sends the request at a predetermined wavelength that is somewhere around 24ghz  in channels  which i ll explain if you want  your wifi router converts the signals back into electrical impulses  which are then sent via cable to the internet  when the webpage is returned  your router converts the electrical impulses into radio waves at the same wavelength that the original message came in  if you want anything else about this explained  let me know ,0

they use powerful radio transmitters and receivers  they ca nt directly control it with instant feedback because there is a lightspeed delay of a number of minutes between earth and mars  because of this  they have to work on ai so that they can give more general instructions to the the rover like  go over there and zap some rocks  rather than  move your left wheels at 7 kmh  because they do nt have the reaction time for  direct  remote control  radio waves  you can send radio waves thousands of light years into space to distant planets and stars  they just take a long time  the other neat thing is that humans have setup a communications network on another planet  the rovers  the orbiters working together to relay the signals and data ,0
no dividends are not included in earnings  companies with no earnings sometimes choose to pay dividends  paying the dividend does not decrease earnings  it does of course decrease cash and shows up on the balance sheet  many companies choose to keep the dividend at a fixed rate even while the business goes through cycles of increased and decreased earnings,0
diesel engines tend to be less responsive than gasoline engines because gasoline is more volatile  explosive   diesel fuel burns slower  giving a longer power stroke  making it better at low speed  high torque situations  think like big trucks or heavy equipment   in car engines  this high torque  low rpm means that it does nt accelerate as much  but can convert more of the fuel added in the engine to power by better using the oxygen in the air  when you add a turbo charger to the diesel engine  you can burn completely almost all of the diesel fuel  minimizing dangerous biproducts like carbon monoxide and unburnt hydrocarbons  in essence  they ll produce the same overall power as a gasoline engine  but use less fuel doing it and therefore produce less greenhouse gas  so  in summary  diesel advantages are better gas mileage  cleaner emissions  better power  more torque  at slower speeds  for pulling things  doing work  climbing hills  etc   and on occasion costing less for gas  relative disadvantages  in north america diesel costs more than gasoline because it s more fuel efficient  the oil companies get you   they accelerate more slowly  and they can cost more for repairs  depending on whether it s a foreign or domestic vehicle  in north america  where diesel s are rarer  it can sometimes be harder to find a mechanic that will work on it  while in europe diesel mechanics are much more common  in general  diesel vehicles tend to last longer and get better gas mileage  for instance  my diesel vw gets better than 40 mpg  and my honda civic gets about 28  a lot of this is dependent on make and model and a lot of other things  but in general  diesel cars are more fuel efficient  to the point even that it outweighs the somewhat higher cost of diesel  i once owned a mercedes diesel with more than a million miles on it  the only thing you have to realize with the turbo diesel injected cars is that you need to replace the injector at least once or twice during the life of the car and it costs around  2000  i think you still save money on gas even if you factor that in though ,0
the sahara desert is a very large area and it would take a lot of solar panels to cover even a small portion of it solar panels also need to be connected to the electrical grid so that the electricity they generate can be used by people building the infrastructure to connect the sahara desert to the electrical grid would be very expensive and would take a lot of time nin addition the sahara desert is home to many different types of plants and animals that rely on the desert for their survival covering the desert in solar panels could harm these plants and animals and change the desert ecosystem noverall while it might seem like a good idea to cover the sahara desert in solar panels it would be very difficult and expensive to do so and it might have negative consequences for the environment,1
neating human meat is not only unhealthy but it is also illegal and morally wrong it is not a normal or acceptable thing for humans to donnone reason why it is unhealthy is because humans can carry diseases that can be transmitted through the consumption of human flesh these diseases can cause serious illness or even death in people who consume the infected meatnnanother reason is that human flesh is not a safe or suitable food source for humans the human body is not designed to be eaten and consuming it can lead to serious health problemsnnin addition to being unhealthy and illegal eating human flesh is also considered morally wrong by most societies because it involves the exploitation and abuse of another persons body this is not something that should be taken lightly,1

in the past video game consoles and computers did not have as much memory as they do now so they couldnt store your progress in a game as easily because of this video game developers had to come up with a way for players to save their progress in a game one way they did this was by using checkpoints or special locations where the game would automatically save your progress this way if you turned off the game or the console you could start from the last checkpoint you reached instead of having to start the whole game over again nowadays most video game consoles and computers have much more memory so developers can allow players to save their progress anytime they want using an options menu button,1

power plants are a lot more efficient than even the most highly  tuned gasoline engine  also  a growing number of power plants around the world release little or no carbon  eg wind  solar  nuclear   and many power plants are naturally powered  hydro or wind  and generate no emissions  but there is something important to note  all hybrid cars need precious metals for their batteries  and these precious metals take a lot of effort to mine and shit so when all is said and done  you might as well have just bought a non hybrid car most hybrids do nt even get their electricity from a power planet  it is generated by the gas engine  there are better by being more efficient and using less gas  but a hybrid that gets 40 mpg is no better than a non  hybrid that gets the same mileage ,0
youve never saved money  have you ever bought anything  there probably was a small window of time that you had to pool some cash to buy something    in my experience if you make it more interesting by allocating money for specific purposes youll have better results than just arbitrarily saving for a rainy day    allocate your money for different things ie new car emergency travel or starting a new business by isolating your money into different places  ex your new car allocation could be in a savings account at your bank   your emergency allocation can be in cash under your bed   your new business allocation could be in an investment vehicle like a stocks where it could potentially see significant gains by the time you are ready to use it    the traditional concept of savings is gone  there is very little money to be earned in a savings account and any gains will be most certainly wiped out by inflation anyway  allocate your money allocate more with new income and then use it to buy real things and fund new adventures when the time is right,0
url0 was posted earlier today  in which i said   there literally is not an eli5 of it  the proof of it involves 150 pages of advanced math and required numerous new discoveries in sub  branches of mathematics the common person has never even heard of  it s not eli5able  if it were  it would nt likely have taken 400 years of mathematical development to prove it  here is the very broad outline  there are these things called modular forms and these things called elliptic curves  modular forms are a certain kind of function and elliptic curves can be thought of as the solutions to equations like y2  x3  ax  b  you can see some pretty pictures here  url0 it had been a long standing  but not flt long  conjecture that modular forms are the same thing as elliptic curves  ken ribet proved that if flt was false you could use it to make an elliptic curve that could not be modular  so this conjecture would imply flt  by taking a and b in the equation above to be some numbers in terms of a nontrivial integral solution to xn  yn  zn  flt says there are no such solutions   wiles proved enough of the modularity conjecture to use that  it was later finished using his techniques   if you want more detail than that  then you ll need a phd in number theory ,0
the bay of pigs is a place in cuba where a group of cuban exiles with the support of the united states government attempted to invade cuba and overthrow the government of fidel castro in 1961 the invasion was a failure and the exiles were quickly defeated by the cuban military the name bay of pigs comes from the location of the invasion which took place near a bay on the southern coast of cuba called the bahã­a de cochinos or bay of pigs in english the invasion was a significant event in the history of the united states and cuba and it helped to escalate tensions between the two countries during the cold war,1
sure zenos paradox is a thought experiment that raises questions about how we perceive the world and how we can understand things that seem to be infinite the idea is that if you want to travel a certain distance you have to first travel half of that distance but then before you can reach the other half you have to travel half of that distance and so on so you have to keep traveling an infinite number of smaller and smaller distances and it seems like you could never actually reach your destination this might seem confusing but its like if you have a piece of paper and you want to fold it in half but before you can fold it in half you have to fold each half in half again and so on you could keep folding the paper in half forever but you would never be able to fold it all the way in half does that make sense,1
it is generally not necessary to pay taxes on gifts that you receive from your employer however there are some exceptions to this ruleif the gift is considered to be compensation for your services then it may be taxable as income for example if you receive a gift of stock as a bonus for meeting certain performance targets that stock would be considered taxable incomeif the gift is not considered to be compensation it may still be subject to taxes if it exceeds the annual gift tax exclusion amount which is currently 15000 per recipient per year if the value of the gift exceeds this amount you may need to file a gift tax return and pay taxes on the excess amountit is a good idea to consult with a tax professional or refer to the irs guidelines for more information on how to handle taxes on gifts from your employer,1
sap is the most popular erp  enterprise resource planning  software package  it has modules that cover most of the computing needs of running a medium to large company  accounting  hr  manufacturing  inventory  sales and distribution  etc  it is viewed as difficult and costly to implement  in my opinion  because 1  most companies are trying to replace existing systems  you need to have a good understanding of all your business processes and the nuances  sap has a ton of configuration options  which take time and money to set up  however  not all of a companys processes will directly translate  this means trade offs  somewhere 2  moving historical data from legacy systems to sap is not trivial  due to the extensive data mapping required 3  consultants who know sap configuration are nt cheap  4  vendors like sap and oracle  the database under some sap implementations  make money off their wares  sap is an enterprise resource planning package  which means it does all of the boring business stuff that all companies have to deal with  accounting  personnel  inventory  sales and so forth  purely from software development point of view  erp software itself is nt that tricky  erp is one of the oldest fields of software engineering and  really  you ca nt find a more boring field if you tried   there s a number of completely free software packages that probably do the exact same things  even for large businesses  but in the erp world  a whole chunk of the erp software houses  money comes from consulting  every country has different laws regarding the businesses  every field of industry does things a little differently and of course every business has its individual quirks  so the software has to be tailored  it is expensive because it is customized for every customer to some extent  take a home depot or lowes  they would use it to keep stock on shelves  so if you buy a toro model 123 lawnmower at store  5 and another person buys one at store  8 it has to know to order 2 to the warehouse from toro and then direct the lawnmowers to the individual stores  then it has to look at past sales to maybe decide that it is early march so it should order extra ones as it is lawn mowing season or not replenish them because it is september and nobody is going to buy one anytime soon  now take that sort of decision making x 50000 items x 1000 stores and 40 warehouses ,0
it is generally a good idea to diversify your investments across multiple brokerage accounts or even across multiple asset classes this can help to spread risk and potentially improve the overall performance of your investment portfolio however it is important to keep in mind that having multiple brokerage accounts can also involve additional costs and administrative burdensthere are a few key factors to consider when deciding whether or not to open multiple brokerage accountsinvestment goals what are you hoping to achieve with your investments if you have a specific investment strategy in mind it may make sense to have multiple accounts to help you execute that strategyfees and commissions different brokerage firms charge different fees and commissions for their services if you are an active trader it may make sense to have multiple accounts with firms that offer competitive pricingconvenience managing multiple brokerage accounts can be timeconsuming if you prefer to keep things simple it may make sense to stick with a single accountdiversification as mentioned above diversifying your investments across multiple accounts can help to spread risk and potentially improve your overall investment performanceultimately the decision to have multiple brokerage accounts will depend on your personal financial situation and investment goals it may be helpful to consult with a financial advisor or professional to determine the best course of action for your specific needs,1
they actually only hold approximately 95  of the us debt  still a significant chunk and the largest of any foreign country but there s a big misconception out there that they own most of the total debt which is false  well  it s actually more of a two way relationship than it first appears  the best place to start out is by looking at china and it s economy  china is now the pretty much the factory of the world and in order for it to carry on growing  it needs people to buy the goods that it produces  america on the otherhand is the world s biggest consumer  by quite a margin  and it has based it s economy around having cheap products available for people to buy while it has actually cut down on the production side of things  so  looking at the chinese side of things  they need the world s biggest consumer to be pretty flush with cash so that it can keep buying their stuff and they also need to keep the value of their currency down  otherwise their exports would become more expensive   the main way in which they do this is to buy us debt which has the effect of not only handing money to the americans which they can then spend on chinese goods  but also so they can keep their own currency nice and cheap  this act in itself helps both parties to cover some rather ugly truths about their own economies  in the chinese case it s that they have actively discouraged domestic consumption and focus most of their energies on exports  one possible reason for this might be that they fear their own people becoming better off as that might in turn lead to calls for more democracy  something that s a red line for the chinese regime  in the american case  this system masks the fact that america can no longer avail much of it s population with relatively well paid and stable employment as they ve pretty much offshored most manufacturing to the far east  this has lead to much pain at the lower end of the pain scale for many years and the lack of decent bluecollar work has been made up for with the easy availability of credit  a big slice of which is provided by china  so essentially the maths works like this  china buys american debt   america uses that debt to buy chinese goods   china reinvests the proceeds in buying more american debt   and around we go again  in terms of strategy  i do nt think it s some mad chinese powerplay in which they will one day call everything back in with the hope of sinking america  instead  it s a symbiotic and somewhat perverse relationship that was probably created by accident rather than design  edit  spelling unt gramur  the us borrows money by selling bonds  there are many kinds of bonds  but basically if you buy a bond  you are giving the us money now  and they will give you more back later  the us sells bonds on a open market  any person  company or country can buy them  so the us is nt choosing to borrow money from china  they are selling bonds  and china just happens to be buying a lot of them ,0
water itself does not expire but it can become contaminated over time for example if water is left in a bottle for a long time bacteria and other organisms that are present in the air can get into the water and cause it to spoil this is one of the reasons why its important to drink water from clean safe sources and to store it properly another reason is that water can absorb impurities from the container it is stored in such as plastic bottles so its best to drink water that is fresh and has been stored in a clean safe container,1
human bodies have hair in a number of places for a variety of reasons for example eyebrows help to keep sweat and other substances out of the eyes and armpit hair helps to trap odors pubic hair also serves a number of purposes one reason for pubic hair is to help protect the delicate skin of the genital area the hair helps to reduce friction and irritation that can be caused by clothing or other types of contact it can also help to keep the area clean by trapping dirt and sweat pubic hair also has a role in sexual attraction and signaling sexual maturity during puberty people develop pubic hair as a sign that they are reaching sexual maturity and are able to reproduce this is an important part of the natural process of human reproduction and is thought to have evolved as a way to help humans find suitable partners for reproduction overall while pubic hair may not seem as necessary as some other types of hair it serves a number of important purposes and is an important part of human anatomy,1
the onechild policy in china was a population control policy that was implemented by the chinese government in 1979 the policy limited most families in china to having only one child although there were some exceptions such as for families in rural areas and for ethnic minorities the policy was designed to slow population growth in china which has a large population and limited resources the chinese government believed that having fewer children would lead to better living conditions for families and help to improve the overall quality of life in the country to enforce the onechild policy the government used a variety of methods including fines penalties and even forced abortions and sterilizations the policy was very controversial and was criticized by many people for violating human rights in 2015 the chinese government announced that it was ending the onechild policy and allowing families to have two children this change was made in part because the countrys population was aging and there were concerns about the longterm sustainability of the social security system,1

the program has to be written to take advantage of that hardware  the windows gui  for example  being your desktop  that rendering code was written before hardware acceleration was ubiquitous  all of your windows  button  and icons are all rendered  in software   aka on your cpu  and your cpu is nt designed specifically for rendering  so reducing effects improves performance  and some of the big costs in rendering has to do with blending  transparency is expensive  as can be anti  aliasing  and windows desktop rendering is done on a single thread  so no matter how many cpus or cores you have  it wo nt have much of an impact  further  rendering happens on the  main thread   which  i believe  is also responsible for io if memory serves me  when you re busy rendering  there s an event queue of everything you ve clicked or typed that s waiting to be processed  not until the screen is refreshed  many desktop apps are written to be single threaded  so they only execute on one core  so everything the program does happens in sequence  if rendering the window is going to take a long time  everything else in the queue is waiting to get processed  a programmer using c or c as their programming language has to write multi threading code themselves to take advantage of it  microsoft would have to rewrite that whole software layer to take advantage of a gpu  and they re not going to do that  because they re insane about backwards compatibility  instead  they wrote a new gui layer that developers can use going forward  migration is always slow  microsoft will probably keep support for their software rendered gui for decades before they even mark it as deprecated  and then decades more before they remove its availability  if you re talking about windows vista and beyond    disabling visual effects does nt increase performance   more detailed explanation is here  url0 eli5  this checkbox just switches off new system  gpu rendering  and brings back xp cpu rendering  because some software ca nt use new system  starting from windows vista gui is rendered on gpuactually it s pretty complicated for compatibility reasons  old programs still use cpu rendering  and resulted bitmap is passed to gpu for composition and rendering   not all programs are written as such  to send data to a gpu directly  requires a whole lot of programming ,0
when a large ship tips over  the metal that makes up its construction twists out of shape  this means that the door frames twisted  making it hard or impossible to open the doors  and so people got trapped in their cabins in a ship that had taken on water  add that to the fact that now the wall is a very steep floor  and it gets very hard to go anywhere  you ca nt just walk to the outside of the ship and leave  you have to climb there over things that were never meant to be climbed on  so even if you manage to get out of your room  and all the doors between you and outside are open  you still have a huge obstacle course to get through  drowning from getting trapped  getting struck by heavy moving objects as the ship tipped over  and cardiac arrest from panic  i presume  it fell over sideways  people got trapped on the inside which filled with water  and the captain high  tailed it out of there instead of staying to help rescue them ,0
a watershed is an area of land where all of the water that falls on it drains into the same place like a river lake or the ocean imagine a big bowl with lots of smaller bowls inside of it each small bowl is a watershed and all of the water that falls inside it flows into the big bowlnnin the chesapeake bay watershed all of the rain and snow that falls in the area flows into the chesapeake bay this includes water from streams creeks and rivers as well as water that runs off the land from things like farms streets and rooftopsnnwatersheds are important because they help to protect the water that we use and depend on when rainwater or snowmelt flows over the land it can pick up things like dirt chemicals and bacteria if these pollutants enter a waterway they can harm the plants and animals that live there as well as make the water unsafe for people to drink or use by protecting and managing the land within a watershed we can help to keep the water clean and healthy,1
the size of your down payment on a house will depend on a variety of factors including the price of the home the type of mortgage you are obtaining and your personal financial situation here are some general guidelines to considerconventional wisdom suggests that you should aim for a down payment of at least 20 of the purchase price of the home this is because mortgage lenders typically require a down payment of at least 20 in order to avoid private mortgage insurance pmi which is an insurance policy that protects the lender in case you default on your loan pmi can add significantly to your monthly mortgage payments so avoiding it can save you a significant amount of money over the life of your loanhowever it is possible to obtain a mortgage with a down payment of less than 20 many lenders offer programs that allow you to put down as little as 3 or even 0 in some cases these loans typically come with higher interest rates and may require you to pay pmi so they may not be the best option if you have the means to make a larger down paymentin addition to the size of your down payment you should also consider other factors such as your overall financial situation your ability to save for a down payment and your longterm financial goals it may be worth saving up for a larger down payment if it means you can get a lower interest rate on your mortgage or if it means you will have more equity in your home on the other hand if you have the opportunity to buy a home with a smaller down payment and it makes sense for your financial situation it may be worth consideringultimately the size of your down payment will depend on your personal financial circumstances and your longterm financial goals it is important to carefully consider all of these factors before making a decision about how much to put down on a house,1
yes a negative compound annual growth rate cagr is often referred to as a compound annual decline rate cadr the compound annual growth rate cagr is a measure of the average return that an investment earns over a certain period of time expressed as a percentage it is calculated by taking the nth root of the total percentage growth where n is the number of periods over which the investment was made when the cagr is negative it means that the investment has declined in value over the period of time being considered in this case the compound annual decline rate cadr can be used to describe the rate at which the investment has declined it is calculated in the same way as the cagr except that the total percentage decline is used instead of the total percentage growth,1
think about all of the things that cause car accidents   other drivers  cars  mechanical issues  driver mistakes  including alcohol  drugs  let s see how airlines tackle these   there are nt many other planes in the sky  and whenever they re close to each other  near an airport  there s a team of people tightly organizing where they go and when   each plane is fully serviced by mechanics after every single flight  and parts are repaired  fluids are replaced  etc  i take fairly good care of my car  and i m not visiting my mechanic more than once every 2  3 months  many people are much less careful than me  imagine if all of us were getting our cars serviced a few times daily  on top of that  keep in mind that there are only a few commercial jet manufacturers in the world  and these people sell their products for millions  there s a lot more quality going into it than your average honda or ford  even though most commercial cars are made very well   it does nt take much to get a driver s license  but it takes a lot to become a qualified airline pilot  thousands of hours of work  numerous tests  the works  then you get in the cockpit  and you get a buddy in the seat next to you  to take over if you feel sick  tired  or if there s an emergency  once you re in the air  a huge amount of the process is automated  and if you show up to the controls drunk  you re being fired  maybe worse  not sure   with all this in mind  it s easy to see that most ways to crash a plane can be  mostly  controlled  there s an engineering system process called six sigma  url0 the idea of it is that we design to the highest standards possible  so the failures are as low as possible  six sigma is 999999998027  success  and in specific regards to airplanes  when a plane does go down  there are a bunch of very bad problems happening all at once  airplanes have multiple redundant systems in case of failures  if the engines go out  the generator in the tail can come on  and if that fails there s a small wind generator that can pop out to help power the flaps and such   pilot error is also often accounted for in engineering  since the pilots have reaction times  there are various auto  pilot systems to assist landing a 250 ton plane  the planes have a lot of safety measures  it would require many things going wrong at once for it to fall out of the sky  even then most modern planes can go on with one engine  hell some of them could get to safety with one wing ,0
it s actually not clear if this happens at all  martha mcclintock reported that it does occur after a 1971 study  but several studies since then have been published showing that there is no synchronization  as well as several others that do support some sort of synchronization  it is likely that there are some problems with the older studies  even the ones that  did nt  support mcclintock s original findings  for example  many of the studies are based on asking women when their periods start  people do nt remember things accurately sometimes  so their answers need to be taken with a grain of salt  another issue is the length of time for which these studies were conducted  a short period of time  a month or two  could show a pattern which occurs just by chance  mcclintock proposed after a later study that cycles can be slowed down by  pheromones   pheromones are chemicals which animals secrete  in this case  through sweat  which can change the behavior of another animal of the same species  in this case  pheromones are thought to delay menstrual cycles so that they get closer to lining up  let s say we start on day 1 of month 1  on day 10   woman a  ovulates   woman b   who lives with  woman a   has her cycle delayed by a couple of days   woman b  would have ovulated on day 15  but it is pushed back to day 17  this repeats for several months until their cycles line up and neither  pushes  the other back  this portion too has been criticized  several people have questioned the ability of pheromones to alter menstrual cycles at all  as for a reason  why  this happens  in terms of benefits in an evolutionary sense   well  no one s really proposed one yet  personally  i could only see a reason why it  should nt  happen  linking up cycles  and thus pregnancies  could  for various reasons  severely stress the whole group which women live in  imagine you re in a car  sitting in a turn lane with your turn signal on  there are other cars in front of you and behind you in the same lane with their turn signals on as well  have you ever noticed how other people s turn signals sometimes blink in time with yours  but then they ll fall out of sync again  it s like that  i am a woman  and have lived with other women post  puberty for 17 years of my life  our cycles were never completely in sync  although there were times when they were  because noone attacks a bunch of angry women at the same time ,0

the legislators are not directly addressing another legislator  they are addressing the body  or the chair of the body  the idea is that it s not a one  on  one debate forum  but rather a place where the legislator can speak to the entire assembly and make their point  and not to one specific rival  so  when they want to address something another legislator has said  they refer to him in the third person because  again  the speaker is talking to  everybody   most legislative bodies have formalized rules of order and etiquette members are required to follow while deliberating  this imposes a clear structure  and helps to remove ambiguity and maintain respect and decorum when contentious issues are being debated  many organzations  public and private  where items are put to a vote  use some form of this  with  robert s rule of order   url0  being a commonly used system  not sure what you mean  referring to someone else in the third person is pretty normal  especially when there are more than two people involved  any time you re calling someone by their name or title  you re referring to them in the third person  using second  person nouns like  you  would get extremely confusing considering there are like 500 people in congress ,0
the theory which describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime  einstein s general theory of relativity  makes a lot of predictions  and many of those predictions  have been verified   url0   which lends support to the theory  u  robusetceleritus covered it pretty well in the link  the way i ve always explained it is as follows  gravity is classically seen as a force of attracting masses  that means  gravity operates on massive objects  we have also noted that light bends around supermassive objects  light has no mass  it ca nt mass  so the big question is  how does light curve due to the force of gravity  the answer  it does nt  light travels on a geodesic  or the straightest path it possibly can travel on  gr theorizes that the very presence of mass distorts spacetime itself  curving spacetime  this way  a supermassive object will literally bend spacetime until a  straight line  appears as a  curved line  from far enough away  gravity is nt actually causing mass to interact with light  but rather causing mass to interact with  space   which then  interacts  with light the difference between gravity and em is the the force is proportional to the mass rather than the charge  the fact that it is linear is a huge tell tale sign to its nature because the acceleration due to gravity is  therefore  independent of the mass  this leads to the equivalence principle  if you were in a system falling under a uniform gravitational field  there would be no  local  experiment that you could do to prove that you were accelerating because everything would be accelerating at exactly the same rate  this is unique to the gravitational force  it is this principle that leads to the idea that the cause of the acceleration is a property of space itself  of course  there s a bit more to it but that s the first thing you learn about when you re starting on general relativity ,0
rear wheel drive rwd cars are generally considered better for racing than front wheel drive fwd cars because they can put power down more effectivelyrnrnin a fwd car the engines power is delivered to the front wheels which also have to steer the car this can cause a phenomenon called torque steer where the car tries to pull in one direction or the other under acceleration this can make the car difficult to control especially at high speedsrnrnin a rwd car the engines power is delivered to the rear wheels this allows the front wheels to focus on steering the car making it easier to control and allowing the driver to get the most out of the engines powerrnrnthere are other factors that can make rwd cars better for racing as well such as a more balanced weight distribution and the ability to finetune the cars handling with the use of different tire sizes and suspension settings however torque steer is a major reason why rwd cars are often preferred for racing,1
massage therapist here  your muscles are made up of bundles of long thin fibres  these bundles are wrapped in a very thin membrane  fascia   when you use the muscle a lot  the fibres stick together and to the membrane  fibrous tissue feels  lumpy  and that s what you feel when you touch it  so it feels good when someone massages it  because it breaks up the fibrous tissue buildup  i asked my chiropractor this the other day  she gave a pretty simple explanation  the cells that make up your muscles are long strings surrounded by a kind of viscous gel  kind of like microscopically thin spaghetti in hair gel  when you have a knot  the strings of muscle  cells  get stuck together and clump up  rubbing it helps loosen this sticky situation  ha  and encourages blood flow which also helps release the cells from being stuck together  not a great explanation  but it satisfied me  muscle is striated  that means it looks sort of like hamburger in a package at the grocery store  like long strands  all going the same way  stacked atop one another   muscles are wrapped in stuff that s like cellophane  saran wrap or cling film  if you will   that stuff is called fascia  when you move  each little muscle strand moves and works together  it causes the fascia  cellophane  to rub  that friction causes the fascia to get stuck to itself and the surrounding fascia  if you get enough friction  the fascia causes the muscle to not move properly  this may cause discomfort or pain  massage can sometimes break up these areas of knottiness  you can have someone massage the area or you can use tools like foam rollers to help  if you start with soft  light pressure  you may be able to get the muscle to relax and then through patience  get the fascia to not cling and relieve the problem  if you are too aggressive with the pressure to the area  you may cause the muscles to contract and not want to let go  your body is smart and senses an area already under strain and to protect the damaged area  it will tense up and spasm more  that s like taking a freshly chewed piece of gum and throwing it in the middle of the bunched up cellophane layers ,0
sure it s possible  and that s how things were before sim cards  but for the phone companies  it s really about the service they are selling  minutes and data  and really  they do nt give a shit what phone is used as long as you pay your bill  a sim card separates the account from the phone and makes the account portable without involving customer service  i was a manager for a mobile store for 2 years  worked in mobile for 6 and work with mobile tech as a hobby  i really like mobile  sim cards work like this  imagine going to a night club you pay a monthly membership for  once at the door you swipe a key card and a bouncer lets you in  you still have to pay for the drinks but they cost less and they give you more  now  let s say there is no bouncer at the door to stop people from coming in without paying and drinking at the same discount rate that you do  after a while the bartender s do nt know who is who and have to close the club so they can figure out who is paying  sim cards hold specialized data that is specially encrypted based on the company  the sim card  which has a specially assigned id called an iccid number  is registered with your phone number and encryption key  this key is transmitted to the cell tower which has a registry of every key and every number  once verified the call is routed to the destination line and the other user answers or declines  this is why sometimes when you call there is a slight delay before the ringing begins  the wavelengths and info are more in regards to how the information travels and not regarding to the card itself  lte uses sim card technology but that has to do with the standardization of the frequencies and technology  same principal applies for those as well  hope this helps  feel free to ask me anything if you need more info  a sim card is your subscriber identity module and it contains part of a 2 part key that is necessary to join a mobile network  the sim is used for the cryptographic authentication and handshaking with the network and it is one of the reasons why it s not possible to listen in on peoples wireless telephone conversations  the listening party would need the private and public key the other subscriber is using in order to decode the connection  sim cards are issued to a carrier and are also linked to your imsi and msisdn numbers in the subscriber database for billing and features  this allows a company to give different sim cards to different customers on the same network for billing purposes  for instance pay as you go companies like boost mobile and many of the other telco s that are nt t  mobile  at  t  verizon  or sprint do nt actually own any networks  they instead use another networks infrastructure to piggy back on  and that network gives those users sim cards that attach them to the third parties billing and network capabilities  in other words hypothetically a boost mobile subscriber and a t  mobile subscriber might both be on a tmobile network  but the tmobile infrastructure treats the boost sims differently and bills differently than if the same subscriber had a t  mobile sim  this is not including prepaid information like caml data etc ,0
sure singing happy birthday in movies and public places is illegal because it is copyrighted this means that only the people who own the copyright the creators of the song or their heirs have the right to decide how the song can be used when someone else sings the song in a movie or public place they are using the song without permission and without paying the copyright holders this is called copyright infringement on the other hand cover songs are legal because the people who create cover songs get permission from the copyright holders to use the song they usually have to pay the copyright holders a fee called a license to use the song this is why cover songs are legal and singing happy birthday in movies and public places is illegal,1
aliasing is a phenomenon that occurs when a signal is sampled at a rate that is not high enough to accurately represent the original signal this can lead to errors in the sampled signal which can be difficult to detect and correctnnan example of aliasing might be if you were trying to record a sound with a microphone but the microphone was not able to capture all of the details of the sound the recorded sound might be distorted or muffled and it might not accurately represent the original soundnnthe nyquist frequency is a concept that is related to aliasing it is the maximum frequency that can be accurately represented by a given sampling rate if the sampling rate is too low then frequencies above the nyquist frequency will be aliased or distorted when they are samplednnto explain this concept to a fiveyearold you might say that the nyquist frequency is like a border that separates the frequencies that can be accurately recorded from the frequencies that cant if a sound has a frequency that is higher than the nyquist frequency then it might not be recorded correctly just like a person trying to cross a border might not be allowed to enter a country if they dont have the right paperwork,1

because food is perishable and is easy to produce  mining new gold  without expending more money than you d earn  is pretty much out of the reach of most people  as i recall from achebe s things fall apart  the main character s wealth and social status was determined by his massive cache of yams  some societies did use food as a currency  most notably the aztecs  who used cacao beans as money  gold  however  was used because it s shiny  inert  easily transported  and most importantly  really hard to get more of  making it a stable currency not easily gained or lost except by trade  that means someone who trades for gold can be reasonably certain that he can trade that gold and get the approximate worth of what he originally traded to get it  people do nt tend to use currency if they re going to be screwed over by doing so ,0
okay  so first let s talk about what a  security  is  a security is  in the most generic sense  a thing which you buy today for some price  x  and which you sell in the future for some price  y  with the goal being that y should be greater than x it s a simple idea  you buy low  and then you sell high  and you end up making money on the deal  one type of security is a  share in a mutual fund   you know how you can buy shares of stock which give you an ownership stake in a company  like imagine you own a company that makes widgets  you can divide the ownership of that company up into pieces  called shares  and then give some to yourself and sell the rest  these shares are securities  in the sense that we defined above  they can be bought  held on to for a time  then sold at a different  and ideally higher  price than what was originally paid for them  because in the time between buying and selling the shares became more valuable  a mutual fund works  kind of  like that  it s basically a pool of money which is used to buy securities  but rather than each member of the pool directly owning some of the securities  the securities are owned by the  fund itself   and the members of the pool own  shares in the fund   you might buy a share of a mutual fund which owns shares in the widget company we described above  but then sells those shares and uses the money to buy shares in a different company  one that makes gadgets  when those shares in the gadget company have gained in value a bit  those shares are sold and the money s used to buy shares in yet another company  this one making thingamagigs  and so on  and so on â€¦ but you  as a shareholder in the fund  do nt need to worry about any of that  all you need to know is that the shares you own in the fund as a whole are accruing value over time through the wise buying and selling of securities on the part of the fund manager  the person responsible for managing the fund s portfolio and increasing its value over time  of course  the basic rule of buying and selling assets applies to mutual funds as well  you are not guaranteed to make money  in fact  you are nt even guaranteed to  keep  the money you start out with  it s possible for mutual funds to lose value over time  meaning if you put  10000 into one right now  a year from now your share of the fund might only be worth  9000  so why would you put money into a mutual fund rather than just putting it into an interest  bearing deposit account  or buying bonds with it  because an interest  bearing deposit account or bond investment might  over a year  turn your  10000 into  10300 if you get a good rate â€¦ while a mutual fund  has a chance  of turning your  10000 into  12000 in the same time  there s a chance for bigger returns  balanced by a chance that you might lose value over time   this is pretty rare  though  most mutual funds are well  managed  and give you returns that are  at least  somewhat better than what you could get from risk  free investing over the same period of time   now the question becomes  how do you go about buying shares in a mutual fund  well  the most obvious way is just to walk into the office of some mutual fund someplace and write them a check  but when you do this  you need to know two things  first  the money you use to buy the shares of that fund has  already been taxed   if you earned  30000 last year and paid  10000 of it in taxes  the  20000 you have left is all you have to buy shares of the fund with  the other thing to know is that in the future  when you cash out of the mutual fund   you re going to be taxed again  on the  profits  you made from your investment  the rate at which those profits are taxed depends on how long you stayed in the fund and how much you made when you got out  but the point is the government is going to take a cut  the way around this is to structure your investment as a roth ira  ira stands for  individual retirement account   and a roth ira is a type of ira  named for the guy in the senate who sponsored the law that created it   the virtue of structuring your investment as a roth ira is that if you follow certain rules  you can get  out  of having to pay taxes on the profit the investment pays you  these rules are pretty complicated  and involve contribution limits â€” a limit to how much you can put into your investment every year â€” and seasoning times â€” how long you have to leave the money in the investment before you can take it out  but as long as you work within those rules  a roth ira backed by a well  managed mutual fund can be a really good way to store your money  protect its value against inflation  by getting a return on your investment that s equal to the rate of inflation   and make a decent profit for your trouble  think of a roth ira as just wrapping paper  everybody who has an income has one box of this wrapping paper labeled  roth ira  sitting around  you can put this wrapping paper on pretty much anything you want  mutual funds  annuities  real estate  etc  what this wrapping paper does is camoflages your wrapped up goods from the tax man who comes to visit each april  he comes in  looks around  and says  looks like you got more stuff  you owe me      but he never seems to notice that this roth package gets bigger and bigger  in other words  whatever you decide to cover in your roth wrapping paper will grow without ever affecting your tax output  however  it does nt help you pay any less taxes on the money you decide to put into it   from your paycheck  for example   you still have to pay your regular taxes on money  before  it gets put in the roth wrapper  sooo  the real question is what are you going to put in your roth ira wrapping paper  you  could  put some bonds in there  but you ll probably never make it to a million dollars  you  could  put some stocks in there  and if you choose well you  might  make it to a million  this is the time where you have to examine   all   of your investment options to decide which investment best suits your goals  a roth ira is a retirement account where you can contrubite post  tax income dollars each year into funds of your  or an advisors   choosing  the concept of  compound interest   url0  explains why it is important to begin contributing into a roth ira as early as possible  since you already paid taxes on the contributions  you are not taxed when you take the money out at retirement as you would a traditional ira  this is not a get rich quick concept  it is a smart and easy way to get your money to work for you over the long haul ,0
kind of depends on the type  level of the amputation  typically you identify the major nerves and vascular structures and tie them off  followed by cutting all the soft tissue with the bone being last  yeah  i can finally answer something  first  you make skin flaps to make sure that you can cover the wound  then  you cut down to the bone  usually  you clamp the vessels as you go and then tie them off at the end  you also try to cut out of as much nerve as possible to avoid neuromas  not sure if this actually works   at the bone  you can use a bone cutter  but we usually just used a gigli saw  it â€™s a piece of razor wire that you hook up to handles and then saw back and forth  finally  you sew it all back together again  how would they chop it off  battle axe ,0
the flag you see on top of the dukes  of hazzard car  what most people call the confederate flag these days  was one of several battle flags used by southern forces during the civil war  if that was the last time it was used  it would bear no more than a lingering whiff of racism and be mostly unknown to the general public  however  in the 50s and 60s that flag was adopted by klan groups  white supremacists  segregationists  and general racists in their fight against black civil rights  it s just a st andrew s cross and some stars  but the racists of the 20th century took it as their symbol  and their symbol it remains  people try to reuse it  at times it s seen as campy or ironic  but it s like a swastika  the stain remains  people consider it  racist  because it was the flag flown by the confederate states during the civil war  and those were people who were generally opposed to the abolition of slavery  it was the flag used by the confederate states  the rebel southern portion of the american civil war   and incorporated into many state flags following the reconstruction era as a symbol of resistance to  northern aggression   though to be fair  northerners did do a lot of shitty things to southern states during the period   the north continued to use the american flag  though of course it had less stars than it does now  less states   since slavery was one of the main causes of the civil war  despite revisionist claims   it is associated with white supremacy movements and ideas since that time  the south s long legacy in making non  whites second  class citizens during the jim crow era  basically post  reconstruction until the 1960s  also increased the association between those with a fondness for the rebel flag and racism  in addition  it was and is used by many racist organizations and individuals as a symbol of their beliefs  to be fair  however  for some it is a symbol of southern cultural identity without overt racist elements  but i generally feel that this argument is too ontological and ignores the strong associations the flag has and the effect embracing it has on people who think about those associations  for me  no matter what other associations the flag might have  its strongest association is with a nation that  as one of its core policies  viewed an entire race as lesser humans and would  and did  via jim crow laws  use government power to deny basic freedoms that i believe all human beings have ,0
black is not the absence of color but rather it is a color in and of itself it is created by mixing together different colors or by absorbing all colors of light for example if you mix together the colors red blue and yellow you will get the color black however this method of creating black is not very practical because it would require a lot of paint or ink a more common way to create black is to use materials that are good at absorbing light such as carbon or lampblack when light hits an object that is black it is absorbed by the object rather than being reflected back to the viewers eyes this is why black objects appear dark so to make things like markers or crayons that are black manufacturers will use materials that are good at absorbing light such as carbon or lampblack and mix them with other ingredients to create a substance that can be used to make marks on paper or other surfaces,1

the spicy chemical  capsaicin  binds to the vanilloid receptor 1  the simple explanation is that these receptors do nt exist in between your mouth and your bum  the chemical capsaicin is in spicy food  this chemical attaches to the the receptors in your body that detect heat  and tricks them into thinking they are detecting physical heat  this is where the burning feeling comes from  you do not have many these receptors in your digestive system  so you do nt feel it  i get a burning sensation in my belly when i eat spicy food,0
they would combine into a larger black hole  i suggest watching  this video   url0   which gives a pretty good answer to your question  edit  only the first 230 of the video applies to the question  the rest is a totally different topic  for some reason  what you have to remember is that black holes are nt actually  holes   black holes are incredibly dense celestial bodies that have a gravitational pull strong enough to trap even light  this means that at the center of every black hole is a lump of matter  if two black holes collided it would essentially be the same as two other celestial bodies colliding  but the two would inevitably combine and form an even larger black hole  a black hole in the center of our galaxy is in the process of combining with a black hole in the center of the andromeda galaxy  and this will happen in the next 4  5 billion years ,0
the saying a picture is worth a thousand words is often attributed to fred r barnard an american advertising executive it is thought that barnard first used this phrase in an article he wrote for a trade magazine called printers ink in 1927 the saying has since become a popular way to describe the idea that a single image can convey a complex or nuanced message more effectively than a large amount of written or spoken language it is a common saying that is often attributed to american newspaper editor arthur brisbane who is said to have written in 1911 use a picture its worth a thousand words however it is possible that the saying originated earlier and was simply popularized by brisbane the idea behind the saying is that a single image can convey a complex idea or story more effectively than a large amount of text the phrase a picture is worth a thousand words is a saying that means a single image can convey a complex idea or tell a story just as effectively as a large amount of text the exact origin of this phrase is unclear but it has been in use for many years and is believed to have originated in the early 20th century it is often attributed to american journalist and newspaper editor arthur brisbane who is reported to have used the phrase in his writings in the 1910s and 1920s however it is also possible that the phrase was in use earlier and was simply popularized by brisbane,1
prison and jail are both places where people are held as punishment for breaking the law the main difference between the two is that prisons are for people who have been sentenced to serve time for longer periods of time often years jails are for people who are waiting for their trial or who have been sentenced to serve a short period of time usually less than a yearnnin the united states prisons are run by the federal government or by the states while jails are usually run by cities or counties in other countries the way that prisons and jails are run can be differentnnso to summarize both prison and jail are places where people go if they break the law but prison is for longer stays and is usually run by the government while jail is for shorter stays and is usually run by cities or counties,1
i believe moving reimbursement has to be counted as income no matter when you get it id just put it under miscellaneous income with an explanation,0
assuming you buy the services and products beforehand and then provide them to your clients should the cost of these products and services be deducted from my declared income or do i include them and then claim them as allowable expenses you arrive at your final income after accounting for your incomings and outgoings   regularly buys products and services on behalf of clients these are your expenses invoice them for these costs after these are your earnings these are not exactly allowable expenses but more as the cost of doing your business so it will be deducted from your earnings there will be other business expenses which you need to deduct from your earnings and then you arrive at your incomeprofit so before you arrive at your income all allowable expenses have been deducted include on my invoices to clients  vat if you charge vat any charges you require them to pay ie credit card charges etc you dont need to inform clients about any costs you incur for doing your business unless required by law if you are unsure about something browse the govuk website or obtain the services of an accountant accounting issues might be costly on your pocket if mistakes are committed,0
sounds feasible  i make 45000 a year with two car payments credit card and student loan debt  also my wife doesnt work  i was approved for a 116000 house with a usda loan  there are limits or how much debt you can have when applying for a usda sorry i cant remember off the top of my head and youll also be getting the house inspected under different regulations   for instance we couldnt get approved until the seller put a handrail on a set of exterior stairs  that regulation is specific to usda along with a few others im living in southern indiana and this just happened a couple months ago for us make sure you have some money set aside for various things like a lawn mower and if the siding blows off the night after you move in yup that happened  also shop around for homeowners insurance  we did some hunting and we found a provider who was willing to price match and ended up saving some money on our car insurance as well,0
a home equity loan is a loan that is based off the difference between the value of the house and the current balance of the primary mortage  if you paid  50000 for a house that s worth  75000  you can get  25000 in equity loans  subsequently  if your house was worth  75 k when you bought it and it s now worth  135 k because reasons  you can now get that much more in your equity loan  in theory  you do nt have to wait at all to get a loan  if you sign on the dotted line for the  75 k house for a  50 k mortgage  you could turn right around that day and get a  25 k equity loan  you just have to have the equity in the house to get the loan  to take a home equity loan  you need to have a significant enough chunk of equity in the house that you still have enough left in the house beyond what you borrow  say you buy a house for  100k and put down the standard 20   you probably could nt borrow against that because that 20  is the baseline equity lenders want on a house  if the house rose in value to  150k  then you d be able to borrow against that gain in equity  plus whatever gains you had by paying down the mortgage   so in reality  it s usually a few years after buying that one has enough equity to borrow against  you can think of equity as what would end up in your pocket if you sold your house and paid back your mortgage today  suppose you just bought your house yesterday for 200k with a 20   40k  down payment  if you sold it now  you d probably get the same price  now you have 200k  but you need to pay off the rest of your mortgage  160k  and you re left with 40k in your pocket  that s your equity  though in this case it s really just money you already had before you used it to make the down payment  now suppose you bought your house 29 years ago for 100k on a 30  year mortgage  there is only 3k left on your mortgage  if you sold your house now for 200k  you d end up with 197k in your pocket  so your equity in that situation is 197k  some of that equity came from the fact that you now pretty much own an expensive asset  your house  and some came from the fact that the asset appreciated in value since the time you paid for it  a home equity loan then is essentially a promise to sell your house and give the proceeds to the bank  in return for making that promise  the bank gives you money now  you do nt ultimately  have  to pay the bank back by selling your home  if you won the lottery or something  that money s just as good  however  the reason the bank is willing to loan you the money is because they know that if all else fails  you can sell your house to pay them back ,0
looking at that eye chart in a mirror that s reflecting the actual chart mimics the 20  feet distance that is needed for such tests  in other words  not all exam rooms have a 20  foot distance to measure  evaluate your vision  it s a useful work  around for a small exam room  your attempt at humor aside  the term for normal visual acuity is 2020  if you have 2020 vision  you can see clearly at 20 feet what should normally be seen at that distance  the mirror allows the examiner to measure the patient s vision over that distance  my doctor has it in front of me  maybe space constraints in a smaller office ,0
trading stocks and commodities can both be easy or difficult depending on various factors such as the traders experience and knowledge the market conditions and the strategies used here are a few differences between trading stocks and commoditiesdifferent markets stocks are traded on stock exchanges while commodities are traded on commodity exchangesdifferent instruments stocks represent ownership in a company while commodities are physical goods such as gold oil or wheatdifferent drivers the prices of stocks are influenced by a wide range of factors including the companys financial performance market trends and investor sentiment the prices of commodities are influenced by supply and demand as well as global economic and political eventsdifferent risks trading stocks carries the risk of loss due to market fluctuations and companyspecific risks trading commodities carries the risk of loss due to market fluctuations and the risk of physical deliveryit is important to understand the differences between trading stocks and commodities and to carefully consider the risks and potential rewards before deciding which market to trade in,1
there are laws that prohibit companies from making false or misleading claims in their advertising however it is often difficult to prove that a specific claim is false or misleading especially if the claim is subjective or open to interpretation in the case of comcast and their xfinity brand it is possible that they are making claims about the speed of their internet service that are technically true but may not be relevant or meaningful to all consumers for example they may be basing their claims on certain measurements or criteria that may not be the same as what other companies are using or they may be focusing on certain areas or regions where their service is particularly fastnnit is also important to note that companies are generally allowed to make puffery or exaggerated claims in their advertising as long as the claims are not meant to be taken literally and are not likely to deceive consumers puffery is a way for companies to promote their products or services in a way that is intended to be attentiongetting or persuasive but not necessarily factualnnif you believe that a companys advertising is false or misleading you can report it to the federal trade commission ftc which is the government agency responsible for regulating advertising in the united states the ftc can investigate complaints and take action against companies that violate the law including by requiring them to stop making false or misleading claims in their advertising,1
websites need mobile versions because phones and tablets have smaller screens than computers so its easier to use a version of the website thats designed to fit on a smaller screen surfing the web on a phone or tablet is also different because people often use their phones when theyre on the go so its important for websites to be easy to use on a phone with a touch screen,1
sure i can try to explain the history behind the hostility between serbia and albania in a way that is easy to understand serbia and albania are two countries located in the balkans a region in southeastern europe the balkans have a long and complex history with many different ethnic groups and cultures living in the region one of the main sources of tension between serbia and albania is their different cultural and ethnic backgrounds serbia is predominantly slavic while albania is predominantly albanian the two countries have also had different experiences with colonialism and occupation which has contributed to their differences another factor that has contributed to the hostility between serbia and albania is the conflicts that have occurred in the balkans over the years including the balkan wars and the yugoslav wars these conflicts have often involved disputes over territory and ethnic and religious tensions and have left a legacy of bitterness and distrust between the two countries finally there have also been instances of political and economic tensions between serbia and albania including disputes over energy resources and trade overall the hostility between serbia and albania has been shaped by a combination of cultural historical and political factors,1
when you first wake up in the morning your voice may sound different because your body is still getting used to being awake when you are asleep your body relaxes including your throat muscles this can cause your throat to feel a bit tight and your voice to sound a little hoarse or raspyrnrnimagine you have a rubber band when the rubber band is stretched out it is easy to stretch and bend but when you let go of the rubber band it becomes more stiff and less flexible its kind of like that with your throat muscles when you wake up they may feel a little stiff and not as easy to move as they do when you are fully awake and your body is more relaxedrnrnas you start to wake up and move around your body will become more alert and your throat muscles will loosen up which should make your voice sound more like it normally does,1
the thoracic diaphragm is the major muscle involved in taking deep breaths  it attaches to the inside of the lower ribs and the oblique muscles  when in contracts it pulls the lungs down and pushes the liver and other organs down  too  like any muscle it will ache after extended use if it is not used to working that hard for so long  the stitch you feel is just the diaphragm telling you it is getting tired and needs a breather  so to speak  the best way to avoid this is to train the diaphragm with breathing exercises and running within your limits which will increase as the muscle becomes more efficient  i m definitely no expert  but my husband was told to prevent them by staying hydrated and controlling his breathing  my guess is that since you re working your body  it needs more of this simple fuel  oxygen and water  in order to functioning efficiently  and the pain is letting you know that your body is thirsty or needs more air  i m pretty sure it has something to do with the fact that while running you often match your breathing speed to each time a foot hits the ground and all the muscles involved in breathing get  sore  when coupled with the exertion of the impact of each foot  which is why changing your breathing pattern usually makes them go away  breathing in through your nose and out your mouth  ,0
the answer to your question doesnt depend on who you trade with but what country you live in if you live outside of the us you will have to pay tax on dividends sometimes this depends on the tax treaty that your country has with the us canada australia uk and a few other countries have favorable tax treaties with the us that allow you to not be double taxed you must look into the tax treaty that your home country has with the us to answer the question each country is different,0
in general terms  a space elevator usually works something like this  1  geostationary orbits  gso  are roughly 22000 miles above the earth  an object in such an orbit is always directly above a single point on the earth s surface  2  the size of the satellite does nt matter  so long as its center of gravity  cg  is on that orbital path  3  so  if you could build a large space station in a gso  you could in theory build a ladder or elevator cable all the way down to the earth s surface  it would touch down at the spot directly beneath the satellite  4  one way to build a large space station in a gso would be to move a decent  sized asteroid into that orbit  then hollow it out for living space and also for raw materials  5  but to maintain the cg of the satellite  you d also have to add mass outside the gso path  one way to do this would be to build another ladder or cable extending outward  6  if you can get all this to work  getting to the space station would be as easy as riding up an elevator  continuing past the space station on the far end of the cable gets you to a pretty easy way to launch spacecraft  just get to the end and disconnect your craft at just the right moment to go anywhere in the solar system  7  of course  all of the materials and processes needed for this are still in the realm of science  fiction  so far  we do nt have 22000  mile  long cables that can take the forces in question  nor do we have the capability to move planetoids around the solar system  we do nt yet have strong enough materials to create this  the matrial has to be long enough and strong enough so as not to break under its own weight from gravity and the forces of being in orbit on one end and planted in the ground at the other  in short  we need something as strong as a spider web but in the size of a suspension bridge cable  which we ca nt yet produce  imho  it will actually work  and it will be a total game  changer with respect to how humanity interacts with the rest of the solar system  there are several companies out there who are actively working on space elevator technology  mostly  though  they re working piecemeal on the necessary supporting technologies  which include   materials science  as others have already explained  we need super  cables  the forces involved in a 40000  kilometer cable swinging through a full 360 degree rotation once per day are  let us say  substantial   deployment  let s say you can make a 40000 kilometer cable that s strong enough  now how the hell are you going to deploy the thing  most of the going proposals  afaik  involve winding it up  launching it into orbit  and unspooling it simultaneously upwards and downwards  so its center of gravity stays at the right elevation the whole time   transport  ok  so you ve got your cable in place  how are you going to get stuff up and down on it  basically  you ve got your elevator shaft  now what about the elevator car  lots of engineering challenges in building a vehicle that can climb 20000  kilometers up to geosync orbit  survive the environmental conditions from sea level to hard vacuum  provide life support for crew on the dayslong journey  et cetera  just providing power to the elevator car is a big challenge  what do you use  small nuke plants  beamed laser power  some kind of electrical rails built into the elevator cable  who knows   general safety  operational concerns  how do you manipulate the cable to keep it out of harm s way  from orbital debris and such  once put in motion  how do you stabilize the cable  and keep it from oscillating out of control  and how do you protect against outright sabotage  terrorist attacks  et cetera   maintenance  damage is a given  it s not if  but when  so  when a micrometeorite dings a hole in the thing  or whatever  how do you fix it  chances are  it will be hard to replicate in a 0 g  vacuum environment and under tension  the same conditions used to manufacture the cable in the first place  anyway  space elevators are an awesome idea  they re just really hard to do  for a very interesting  if speculative  take on it  read kim stanley robinson s  mars  trilogy  red mars  blue mars  green mars  in that series  one sub  plot involves building a space elevator on mars first  which makes a ton of sense  mars s gravity is so much less  that the engineering concerns are hugely reduced  he also explores the likely outcomes of a total failure of the elevator system ,0

the hair on your head and the hair on your body are different types of hair the hair on your head is called terminal hair and it grows continuously because it is genetically programmed to do so the hair on your body on the other hand is called vellus hair and it is shorter finer and lighter in color than terminal hair vellus hair does not grow continuously but rather it grows to a certain length and then stops this is because the hair follicles the tiny structures in your skin that grow hair that produce vellus hair are not as active as the follicles that produce terminal hair so the reason the hair on your body stops growing is because the hair follicles that produce it are not as active as the ones that produce the hair on your head,1
your example is just a movie lot  with fancy editing  a very enclosed space can seem much more expansive  the same can be done when shooting on location  close off half a block of city street and shoot it from three different angles  you can make it seem like you re shooting across half a mile of city  but cgi is used a lot more than you might think to replace backgrounds and add detail  check out  this video    url0  i m willing to bet you never would have guessed that most or even all of those were entirely faked  the walking dead is mostly filmed on location in georgia  the scenes in the first season were filmed on location in atlanta  possibly with a few shots done on a movie lot  woodbury was filmed in senoia  georgia  if you google it  you can see  i was surprised because they basically made it look like the shittiest backlot in the world  some of the suburbs scenes were filmed around there too  they used a real prison for the prison  obviously  edit  the redditor who said it s mostly green screen is talking complete shit  i was re  watching  band of brothers  recently and noticed  because it had been pointed out to me  that every time you see a town or village  it s the  same one   in this case  the producers leased a bit of land near pinewood studios in england and built a couple of streets of generic european housing to film in  they shoot from different angles  dress things differently but once you ve noticed that distinctively  shaped house  or whatever  you have a hard time not seeing it ,0
you can sue for emotional damages for eleven hundred trillion dollars  does nt mean you will get that much if you win  jail time is punishment  restitution is compensation for damages  and who pays depends on who s at fault   how do you calculate damages by being raped by your uncle when you re 8  9 years old  you ca nt  really  so she gets tons and tons of money  most reasonable people would rather have their lives back  but since they ca nt  and they may have massive emotional damage   they get financial compensation  since it s pretty much the next best thing  because their crime  in addition to breaking a law  which would cause the prison time  also causes so much stress  or emotional harm to the victims  familyies   that they are held liable for things like lost work  psychiatric help  etc ,0
same reason you come on reddit a little more than you should  knowledge itself is addictive  if you get a bit of information  your brain shoots off a bunch of drugs saying  do that again  it s going to be usefull   like how fatty foods are  addictive  but not really a drug themselves  now  sometime this info is stupid  and sometimes we get less and less of a kick out of this knowledge but with facebook it s not just knowledge  its being addicted to social acceptance  every  like  you get is another dopamine shot from your brain   basically  facebook is good  it provides information and allows us to keep in contact with other people but most people have gone down the path of being on 247 without much to learn or people who like them   also  a lot of people are  fake  on facebook  because they still want to be  liked   not all of facebook  i m not sure on how deep it goes  but a most of the addicts i know  also  most facebook games are made to work like a  pavlov s dog  experiment  facebook games do nt demand skill or provide challenge  they are not puzzling or require knowledge  some do  again  this is just a massive generalisation not to be take too seriously  and you may not be skilled enough for some games  these  games  just drip feed you little rewards to make you do what they want  farmville back in the day was just a  do what you want  you log in every hour and i ll give you bonus gold  like us  bonus gold  you can also buy gold  any other way to get gold  not really  average addiction to facebook i believe stems from jealousy and keeping up with the jones   my ex gf used to be on facebook hours every day just to look at pictures and would get depressed that things we did were nt as fun as what other people did  she would also use it to look at pictures of her friends to see which ones looked fat or ugly or whatever  my addiction to facebook is because all my friends use it for all their parties  events  whatever  so if i do nt log in at least once every few days i do nt hear about shit i potentially want to do with them  people are social  facebook allows you to be social even if there is nt a physical person close to you  you can post an update and have one of your friends respond and get feedback  its safe so there minimal risk of getting emotionally hurt and if some one does you ca block them or easily ignore them  its also safe in the aspect of you do nt have to put yourself at risk by meeting new people because its kind of hard to as you get older,0
using a paper toilet seat cover can help protect you from germs and bacteria that may be present on the toilet seat toilet seats can sometimes harbor germs and bacteria especially in public restrooms where many people use the same toilet these germs and bacteria can potentially cause illness if they come into contact with your skin or are ingested by using a paper toilet seat cover you create a barrier between your skin and the toilet seat this can help reduce the risk of coming into contact with any germs or bacteria that may be present on the seat while its not foolproof using a paper toilet seat cover can provide some peace of mind and may help reduce the risk of getting sick from germs and bacteria in public restrooms,1

as a person who has had several part time assistants in the past i will offer you a simple piece of advise that should apply regardless of what country the assistant is located if you have an assistant personal or business virtual or otherwise and you dont trust that person with this type of information get a different assistant  an assistant is someone who is supposed to make your life easier by off loading work modifying your records before sending them every month sounds like you are creating more work for yourself not less either take the leap of faith to trust your assistant or go somewhere else  an assistant that you feel you have to edit crucial information from is less than useful that being said there is no fundamental reason to believe that an operation in the philippines or anywhere else is any more or less trustworthy than an operation in your native country however what is at issue is the legal framework around your relationship and in particular your recourse if something goes wrong  if you and your virtual assistant are both located in the us you would have an easier time collecting damages should something go wrong  i suggest you evaluate your level of comfort for risk vs cost  if you feel that the risk is too high to use an overseas service versus the savings then find someone in the states to do this work  depending on your needs and comfort you might want to seek out a cpa or other licensedbonded professional  yes the cost might be higher however you might find that it is worth it for your own piece of mind as a side note you might even consider finding a local parttime assistant this can often be more useful than a virtual assistant and may not cost as much as you think if you can live without someone being bonded  or are willing to pay for the bonding fee yourself  depending on your market and needs you may be able to find an existing highly qualified ea or other person that wants some after hours work   if you are in a college town finance accounting or legal majors make great assistants  they will usually work a couple hours a week for beer money they have flexible schedules and are glad to have something pertinent to their degree to put on their resume when they graduate  just be prepared to replace them every few years as they move on to real jobs,0
in more a scientific sense  entropy is a measure of the probability of certain states  think of a glass of salt water  the most probable distribution of the water and salt molecules is that of an essentially even distribution throughout the glass  this would be considered a state of high entropy as it is very probable on a statistical level  conversely  if all the salt and all the water were to spontaneously separate within the glass to form two distinct layers  there is far fewer distributions of the salt and water atoms that could lead to this state  this would be considered a low entropy system  as it is far less statistically probable  when it is said that isolated systems tent towards a state of higher entropy  it is because those states are more probable and therefore are more likely to occur  this is hard to explain much farther beyond this point without getting into thermodynamics and statistical mechanics  on a related note  one point i want to make is that entropy can decrease in a system that is not isolated  in the case of the earth  entropy of the earth is decreasing as we compartmentalize chemicals and form distinct organisms  this is possible because we re being subjected to massive amounts of energy from the sun  which is then harnessed to go against the favorability of higher entropic states  the sun is gaining entropy by ejecting energy that we use to lower our entropy  if you re interested in a more thorough explanation  this is a good introduction  url0 the term can be used in all sorts of contexts  in really generic  simple language  it s the idea that things naturally get  chaotic  or  messy  overtime  and you ca nt  undo  it  for example  it makes complete sense that an egg would crack and shatter if you dropped it on the ground  but you ll never see a broken egg  re  assemble  itself  even if you spent weeks manually gluing it back together  it will never be quite the same as the whole egg it was at the beginning  similarly  you ll never see wood  un  burn  in a fireplace  or leaves  un  decay  on the forest floor  this concept applies to the univese as a whole  as sophisticated and fancy as we are here on planet earth  it does nt change the fact that our universe is slowly  crumbling   and hurtling towards its inevitable end  all energy will eventually dissipate into a uniformly even mess  one of my favorite short stories  energy dissipates from high energy to low energy  which means that theoretically eventually everything will have even energy and transfer will be impossible  that s vague and simple  but its basically the idea  everything breaking down into the exact same subatomic chaos ,0

balding or hair loss is a common condition that can affect both men and women in men it is most often caused by a combination of genetics and hormonesnngenetics play a significant role in determining whether a person will experience hair loss if someone has a family history of balding they are more likely to experience it themselvesnnhormones also play a role in male hair loss men produce a hormone called dihydrotestosterone dht which can cause the hair follicles to shrink and stop growing new hair this can lead to thinning hair and eventually baldnessnnthere are also other factors that can contribute to hair loss in men such as certain medications medical conditions and lifestyle factors however genetics and hormones are the main causes of male balding,1
if it could it seems yet to be proven  long term capital management was founded by a bunch of math whizzes and they seem to have missed something  id never suggest that something has no value but similar to the concept that if time travel were possible why hasnt anyone come back from the future to tell us id suggest that if there were a real advantage to what you suggest someone would be making money from it already  in my opinion the math is simple little more than a four function calculator is needed,0
there are several steps you can follow to recalculate a bad loan also known as a defaulted or delinquent loan these steps may vary depending on the specific terms of the loan and the circumstances of the borrower but in general you can follow the steps outlined belowreview the terms of the loan before you begin the process of recalculating a bad loan it is important to review the terms of the loan and any agreements or contracts that you have signed this will help you understand the specific requirements and obligations of the loan as well as any penalties or fees that may applydetermine the total amount owed once you have reviewed the terms of the loan you should calculate the total amount that is currently owed this will include any outstanding principal as well as any interest fees or penalties that have accruedreview the borrowers financial situation it is important to consider the borrowers financial situation when recalculating a bad loan this may include reviewing their income expenses and any assets they may have this will help you determine whether the borrower has the ability to make the required payments and if there are any alternative payment options availablenegotiate a repayment plan once you have determined the borrowers financial situation and the total amount owed you can try to negotiate a repayment plan this may involve extending the loan term reducing the monthly payment amount or altering the interest rate the goal of the repayment plan is to make the loan more manageable for the borrower and help them get back on track with their paymentsfollow up and monitor progress after you have negotiated a repayment plan it is important to follow up and monitor the borrowers progress this may involve regular communication with the borrower and tracking their payments to ensure that they are meeting the terms of the repayment plan if the borrower falls behind on their payments again you may need to revisit the repayment plan or consider other options such as debt collection or legal action,1

im sorry but i am not able to browse the internet or access any information beyond what i was trained on so i am unable to provide you with information about the specific knife you mentioned or any developments that may have occurred after my knowledge cutoffin general if the knife that was found on oj simpsons property was determined to be the weapon that was used to kill nicole brown simpson it could potentially be used as evidence in a criminal trial against him however it is important to note that in order for the knife to be used as evidence it would need to be properly collected and handled in accordance with the laws and procedures in place at the time and a thorough investigation would need to be conducted in order to determine its relevance to the case,1
because health care is a very lucrative profit vector  and in a capitalist society  giving anything away for free is frowned upon  even education for that matter  is more  valuable  when you pay for it  have you seen our public education  i ll pass on health care at that quality level  thank you  because the healthcare  health insurance and pharmaceutical industries are incredibly corrupt and incredibly powerful ,0
sometimes companies choose to use different brand names in different countries because the original brand name might not be easy to pronounce or remember for people who speak a different language for example lays chips are called walkers in the united kingdom because the word lays is difficult for some english speakers to pronounce using a different brand name in each country can help the company reach more customers and make it easier for people to understand and remember the brand however changing the brand name can also be confusing for customers who are familiar with the original name and it can make it more difficult for the company to build a strong international brand,1
if i remember correctly  an engine does not work at peak efficiency when it is doing its max output  which means an engine that maxes out at 75 mph will do more works and uses more fuel at highway speeds than an engine that maxes out that 175 mph  1  because d class cars can be used in d class professional racing 2  extra speed is a byproduct of the qualities an engine has to have in order to operate well at sub maximal speed  if a car only had enough power to run 65mph  it would have shitty performance  to get the power you need to merge onto the freeway  you end up with power to go well above 65   and sometimes you need to run from the cops ,0
the pro  argument  increasing the minimum wage will increase the buying power of a large segment of the population  this will allow consumers to spend more  improving the economy and encouraging growth  it will enhance social mobility  allowing the poor to accumulate more saving and investment  which will spur more entrepreneurial behavior and reduce the burden on the government to provide social programs  it is just  because people should  as a matter of right  be paid enough to live and too low a wage unfairly advantages the rich  who have too much bargaining power  the con  argument  raising the minimum wage will reduce the number of jobs available  worsening unemployment and making it harder for young people and the long  term unemployed to find jobs  since a company risks more hiring someone if they have to pay them more   it will make it harder to have start  ups  because they will need more capital and more cash flow to stay afloat  it will make things more expensive  particularly cheap things that the poor are disproportionately dependent on  hurting the poor more than it helps them  even if they do have jobs  it is unjust  because it interferes with people s right to decide how much they re willing to accept to do a job and unfairly biases the system in favor of the already employed  pick your poison  the  15 number itself  as i understand it  is selected as an update to the minimum wage consistent with where it was when it began  but the argument about whether it s the right number exactly  as i understand  is purely economic  edit  note also  i am not weighing in on the empirical question of which path is more likely  people who support the pro  argument cite models based on distributional effects  the stickiness of prices  price competition  and incentives  the con  arguments use models based on reasonably efficient markets  less  sticky prices  wage competition and different incentives  this is nt one of those issues  so far as i know  open to correction   like rent control  where although some people make  fairness  arguments every study ever says that it hurts poor and rich alike  helping only a select few  the empirical side of the question is more open than that  and so while there s surely an economics argument to be had  and one that you might find persuasive  the two arguments above are equally  reasonable   though only one can be right in given conditions  the answer would depend on who you ask  personally  i think it would lead to a giant leap in the price of just about everything  the bigwigs running the big companies will just raise their prices to maintain their own exorbitant earnings  the people getting the raise would soon find that the cost of living has gone up so much that the higher wage would be offset by the higher price to be paid for everything   1000 happy meals   1000 a gallon gas  stuff  unemployment would likely increase  and the ones hurt the most would be the middle class  who already make more than that  but would likely see no or little corresponding increase in income to offset the higher cost of living  small business owners would probably get hit hardest of all  and many would close in the short term  unable to absorb the labor costs  it might help the working poor in the near term  but in a fairly short time  they d be right back in the same boat  not making enough to pay for basic necessities  if you tried some scheme like tying the minimum wage to inflation  you would end up setting up a sort of  feedback loop  where the one just keeps going up because of the other  this is my personal opinion  but i do nt think a  scientific  answer to the question exists  it s a very heated and very subjective debate  the immediate effect would be a notable  but temporary  spike in unemployment  as not every employer will be able to afford the wage spike  and not every employer who can afford it will do so  this is followed by the effect of increased demand by people who spend the most of their income  suddenly  their income has doubled  and they re spending nearly all of it  this is quite unlike money going to the top 1   who spend nearly none of it  and banks are nt currently investing what they are saving  the two results of actual increased general consumer demand are 1  inflation and 2  higher employment  inflation is often spoken of as a bogeyman  but it would also make outsourcing and importing  less  attractive  resulting in  higher local employment  there would probably be other effects as well  but those are the easiest to describe  whether or not we d end up seeing better overall employment at  15  hour is a matter of debate  but if i were forced to bet  i d say that unemployment would eventually fall below pre15  hour levels within two years ,0
it s an easy thing not to notice  most people do nt know what their district looks like  if people do nt like what politicians do  they are fully in their rights to vote them out  and vote in new ones that will do something different  not enough people care about gerrymandering  or they do nt care about gerrymandering in their state because it s beneficial to their party  to make it an electability issue  so politicians will continue to gerrymander  because districts do  on occasion  need to be changed as populations shift  so normally when gerrymandering occurs  it s under the guise of a necessary redistricting ,0
short answer  you can not withdraw from the union  longer answer  pennsylvania and new york  if in remembering correctly  would have never joined the union if it was perpetual  however lincoln established the de facto precedent that you can not withdraw with the civil war  this was later backed in a supreme court case i can not recall   possibly unintentionally  although he was certainly a proponent of keeping the union together  the prevailing view is that the states do not have the legal right to secede  the reasoning is this  the  articles of confederation   url0   which were the governing rules of the united states before the constitution existed  declared the union to be  perpetual   ie everlasting  the articles of confederation were replaced by the constitution  and the constitution does nt say anything like  perpetual   however  it does say that its purpose  in part  is to make the union more perfect  and the articles of confederation were not  the union   the fact that they were replaced as the operating rules of the union does not imply that the perpetual union was replaced along with them  in fact the articles themselves  along with saying  the union  is perpetual  say that the articles can be replaced  lincoln claimed  the union  actually predates even the articles of confederation  he said   the union is much older than the constitution  it was formed  in fact  by the articles of association in 1774  it was matured and continued by the declaration of independence in 1776  it was further matured  and the faith of all the then thirteen states expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual  by the articles of confederation in 1778  and finally  in 1787  one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the constitution was to form a more perfect union  this view of a perpetual union  unaffected by the replacement of the articles of confederation  was made explicit by the supreme court in 1869  in the case  texas v white   the court s decision read  in part   by  the articles of confederation   the union was solemnly declared to  be perpetual   and when these articles were found to be inadequate to the exigencies of the country  the constitution was ordained  to form a more perfect union   it is difficult to convey the idea of indissoluble unity more clearly than by these words  what can be indissoluble if a perpetual union  made more perfect  is not  there has since been nothing contradicting that  and although there are of course people who want their state to secede  there has nt been any serious legal headway of any sort along those lines  what it boils down to is that if a state wanted to secede and become its own country  the rest of the united states would have to agree to it  or else it d be another civil war situation  it s very unlikely  given the us s position in the world  that any other major country would come to the aid of the seceding state  and with the military might the us has  it would nt be much of a war  in practical terms  it s not possible ,0
society is nt a huge fan of the natural way many african american women s hair grows so fake hair is easier than chemical straighteners or something  my mom recently told me this  since she has been a cosmetologist for decades and is of african descent  i believe she defined it best  i will give it my all to explain why weaves and wigs are very common among african  american women  firstly  we must not forget the progression madame cj walker had done for many african  american women when it came to making a product that would benefit them in maintaining hair in a specific manner  i can not recall all of the details  i shall ask my mother again when she is present for this  if anything  you would find some information about her on google  i just prefer how my mother articulates her   next  if you would look back onto the  1970 s   url0   many women wore their hair in this fashion  it was fairly easy to maintain as well as have a sense of identity  it was pretty much the hair of the time  it was culturally accepted and gave a sense of womanhood  it was not until around the late 1970 s to early 1980 s  if i am not mistaken  when we started to see jehri curls emerge into black culture for cosmetics  it was a way  of course to make hair have a more straighter appearance  once again  this was the whole idea of what hair was reasonably acceptable and easy to acquire  jumping forward and skipping a decade  you start to see many models start to make their hair immensely straight  celebrities would be the first to venture into this and i do believe beyonce was the most noticeable  we see a shift in hair changes every decade if not 5 years  and go directly into the question  it is because people have grown used to it and have socially accepted  usually during conventions  they discuss ideas  and say what would come out next year as a new way to do hair by improving on something old  it s a constant growing art  i hope this answers the question  i will be sure to ask my mother more about this at a reasonable time  thank you for reading my input even though i am not an expert at this  kudos to all cosmetologist out there and to those that are moving with times to find a new identity  as someone who moved from africa to america  i usually find that is mostly a social aesthetic reason  many individuals of african descent have very course  curly  unique hair  it also has different oils and growth rates  the hair can be very dry  and tangle easily  ever hear the term nappy hair    because of many social standards  the long sleek hair that many individuals of the caucasian  hispanic or asian decent have  has become more desirable  many girls now get weaves  the natural hair is braided very close to the scalp and the fake hair is then sewn in  or use lye  a chemical used in the production of soap  relaxers to condition and straighten the hair out  some women add extensions on after this to have longer  more even hair  as far as what i ve seen  many women hate their natural hair as a result of society s current standard of beauty  for some  maintenance can be tedious ,0

the internal rate of return irr is a measure of the rate of return that is expected on an investment it is calculated by determining the discount rate that results in a net present value npv of zero for a series of cash flows which can include both positive and negative values the irr calculation takes into account the timing and magnitude of all cash flows associated with an investment including revenues costs and any other inflows or outflowsthe irr calculation uses revenues rather than profits because it is based on the total cash flows associated with an investment including both revenues and costs profits are calculated as revenues minus costs while the irr calculation looks at the total cash flows both inflows and outflows to determine the rate of returnthe irr calculation is used to evaluate the potential profitability of an investment or project by comparing the expected rate of return to a required or target rate of return it is a useful tool for comparing the potential returns of different investments or for deciding whether to pursue a particular investment or project,1
in logic a conjunction is a compound statement formed by combining two statements using the logical connective and the conjunction is true only if both of the statements being conjoined are truennnnfor example the statement it is raining and the grass is wet is a conjunction this statement is only true if both the statement it is raining and the statement the grass is wet are true if either of these statements is false then the conjunction as a whole is falsennnnthe symbol for conjunction in symbolic logic is âˆ§ for example the statement it is raining âˆ§ the grass is wet could be written using this symbolnnnnin general a conjunction can be thought of as a way to combine two statements in such a way that the resulting compound statement is only true if both of the original statements are true,1
helloi have gone through your query and understood the concern there is no need to use an emergency contraceptive pill around the menstrual period because this is the safe period ovulation occurs two weeks prior to the onset of the next period and this is the fertile period so in the manner you have described you cannot get pregnant and hence there is no need to worry also restrict the use of emergency contraceptive pills to once or twice a year since they have a high hormone content and hence disturb the hormone milieu of the body badly hope this helps,0
i m no expert  not even close  but a few days ago i saw an expert on television and his eli5 was excellent  i will try to put it here  imagine that you are walking in the woods  now imagine that you can smell  taste  see  feel  but you ca nt hear  you ca nt hear anything at all  now  if you suddenly would get access to all of your hearing ability  then the woods would make a very different impression on you  because you would now have access to a new sense and suddenly all sort of things will be visible which you previously could not even suspect  for example the sounds animals make and what about the wind or  falling   trees  and so on  hearing is an extra sense for getting through the woods or examining it  with it the woods are easier to explain  travel  now back to gravitational waves  if those waves exist  we  have another sense available to us to explore space  gravitational waves will be a new way to look at everything in space  we will probably discover many things which have been right under our noses  and i think that s pretty amazing or even groundbreaking  because its one of the fundamental things we do nt understand about gravity  we do nt really know what part of an atom actually reacts with gravity  and we do nt know the method that gravity interacts with various particles  finding a  gravitational wave  would explain both of these it would prove a significant part of einstein s general relativity  and would be an example of the curvature of space  time  they would also be an amazing exploration tool  because theoretically a gravitational wave would be able to go to regions of space an electro  magnetic wave could not  this would allow scientists to  see  inside cosmic phenomena that would normally be impossible to witness  such as black hole  where theorys of how quantum level events work break down  it would bring very unique insights into how the universe works  by letting us observe events such as a singularity ,0
there is a possibility of misuse hence it should be shared judiciously sharing it with large  trusted organization reduces the risk as there would be right process  controls in place broadly these days pan and other details are shared for quite a few transactions say applying for a credit card opening bank account taking a phone connection etc in most of the cases the application is filled out and processed by 3rd party rather than the service provider directly  creating fake employee records is a possibility so is the misuse to create a fake bank account in your name and transact in that account since one cannot totally avoid sharing pan details to multiple parties it helps to stay vigilant by monitoring the form 26as from the govt website any large cash transactions  additional salary  or other noteworthy transactions are shown here it would also help to monitor your cibil reports that show all the credit card and other details under your name,0
im not downvoting you because i can relate in a way to your post and i think this is a good topic to have on this site  we had a question a couple weeks ago where someone like you took some friends money to trade with but didnt know how to give the money back or calculate the netreturn  it is not smart to take and invest other peoples money when you have zero industry experience and when you do not understand the legal requirements of handling someone elses money within the first 12 months of my brokerage account i had returned something like 150 i doubled my money plus a bit  the next year was something like 20 if i remember correctly the next year was worse then up again for year four  year 1 i thought i was a genius and had figured this whole thing out year 2 put me in my place and year 3 kicked me while i was down you have 6 months of pretty solid returns good for you  i dont think that means its time to set up shop  really i think you need to sit down and think long and hard about the implications legal and otherwise of holding other peoples money  running a fund is significantly different than trading your own money   retail investors dont typically have a good memory  great you made me 17 last year and 25 the year before but right now im down 10 so give me my money back because i would have been better off in an savings account this year    this is why index funds are in vogue right now  lots of people have had money in active funds that have trailed or matched the safe and passive index funds so theyre angry  retail folks get jittery the instant they lose money no matter how much  you need to be ready to contend with what have you done for me lately the instant something turns negative no matter how positive your returns have been at your stage in the game you should get a job and continue putting your own money in to your own system and be ready to lose some of it  i doubt there is anyone outside your immediate family who will hand a random 18 yearold kid any significant amount of money to trade their system based on 6 months of success certainly not more than you have in there currently,0
people might use the term so instead of boyfriend or girlfriend because it can be a more casual and informal way of referring to their romantic partner it can also be a way of not disclosing too much personal information about their relationship to others nfor example if someone is talking to a friend and they dont want to share the details of their relationship with that person they might use the term so to refer to their partner this allows them to talk about their partner without using specific terms that might reveal more about the nature of their relationship nin general people use different terms to refer to their romantic partners depending on their personal preferences and the context in which they are speaking some people might prefer more formal terms while others might prefer more casual or informal terms,1

oxygen is a gas that our bodies need in order to survive when we breathe in air our bodies take in oxygen and use it to turn the food we eat into energy this process is called respiration and it helps keep our bodies alive and healthynnoxygen is also used by our bodies to help repair and build new cells and it helps to keep our skin and other tissues healthy without enough oxygen our bodies cant function properly and we can become sick or even diennwhen we dont have enough oxygen our bodies cant get the energy they need to do things like move think or even just stay alive this is why its so important to breathe in air that has plenty of oxygen in it if we dont have enough oxygen for a short time we might feel dizzy or lightheaded but if we dont have enough oxygen for a long time our bodies can start to shut down and we can diennso in short we need oxygen because it helps our bodies to stay alive and healthy it gives us the energy we need to do all kinds of things from moving and thinking to just breathing and living,1
imagine that a fund had a large exit load that declined over several years if you wanted to sell some or all of your investment in that fund you would face a large fee unless you held it a long time you would be hesitant to sell because waiting longer would save you money that is the exact opposite of a liquid investment  therefore the ideal level for a liquid fund is to have zero exit load,0

sure slugging percentage is a statistic that measures the power of a hitter in baseball its calculated by adding the number of singles two times the number of doubles three times the number of triples and four times the number of home runs hit by a player and dividing that total by the number of times that player has come up to bat also known as their atbats for example lets say a player named joe has come up to bat 100 times in a season he has hit 20 singles 10 doubles 5 triples and 2 home runs to calculate his slugging percentage we would do the following add up the total number of bases that joe has gotten from his hits 20 singles  1 base  10 doubles  2 bases  5 triples  3 bases  2 home runs  4 bases  80 bases divide the number of bases by the number of atbats 80 bases  100 atbats  08 convert the decimal to a percentage by multiplying by 100 08  100  80 so joes slugging percentage for the season would be 80 the higher the slugging percentage the more powerful the hitter is considered to be,1
it doesnt matter to the credit agencies if there is a cosigner or not however your family member will need to take into consideration if they are willing to be responsible for the loan in the event you are unable to make payments being a cosigner means they are agreeing to pay the loan amount it will also impact their credit scorereport either improve it if all goes well or destroy it if neither one of you are able to pay the loan so to you assuming you can pay all the payments and not default it makes no difference but to the cosigner it could create a huge impact  httpswwwthebalancecomdoescosigningaffectcredit315368,0

thrusters  rockets  engines  etc push against the spacecraft  not the air  the force of the material being expelled creates an equal and opposite reaction on the spacecraft  same concept as the backpack on ice  but you can try this if you ca nt find any ice  imagine you re standing still on a skateboard or some other rolling platform  and you have a bowling ball  conveniently painted like a basketball  in your hands  have your best friend dave stand a few feet away from you and chest pass the ball to dave and you will start rolling in the opposite direction of the ball  it is good that you are moving away from dave because he is mad that you just broke one of his toes and he is angrily running towards you with a limp  the gases from the engine push against the spacecraft itself  much like if you blow up a balloon and then let it go  air goes one way and the balloon goes the other  in fact  i think the balloon would also do that in space  apollo 13 style  like when they had their oxygen leak,0
the movement of the coil  or the ribbon  or the plates  depending on mic type  moves in the same way the sound does in the air  it s sort of like an auditory photocopy of the sound that travels through the air  the sound waves hit the coil  or whatever   the coil vibrates in the same way  then gets amped  etc   since microphones are analogue imperfect  those imperfections create a certain character that s unique to some mics  but not enough to fundamentally change the tone  each pitch you hear is not really a separate thing  it s all a wave in the air  a higher pitch is a wave that moves between peak and trough more quickly  high frequency  and a lower pitch moves more slowly  but when you have both playing at the same time  they mix into a single wave that is more complex  here is an image i made showing waves from my recording program  url0 what you see are three different waves  and as you go left to right you are going forward in time  as you can see the lower pitch goes up and down slower than the higher pitch  the last image is what it looks like when you play both at the same time  they just add together  and since they do nt match up perfectly you get a squiggly wave  and that s how it is  through the whole process  the air  the mic  the storage medium  then the speaker  and the air again  and your ear  until it hits your brain  your brain is the only thing that hears two separate things  the easiest way to think of a microphone is like a backwards speaker  that s just what they are  in a speaker the cone moves and creates air vibrations just like when sound is naturally created  in a microphone  you have a  diaphragm  inside that s similar to the cone  only the air moves it instead of it moving the air  that wave hits the diaphragm of the mic and the diaphragm moves along with it in the same way  and that movement is converted into a voltage  moving up and down between positive and negative voltage  then you can record it and play it back  i simplified how the mic works a bit because you have some in depth explanations in other comments  feel free to ask if there is something you re not clear on  sound is conduction  molecules move with when a source vibrates  causing molecules around it to move which causes more molecules to move until there is no more molecules  or there is nt any more energy to move anything  microphones pick up this movement via a thing called a diaphragm within the microphone  in a dynamic mic  the mic you see on stage or at a stand up comedy gig  most recognizable being the shure sm58   has a diaphragm that sits on top of a magnet  with a coil surrounding it  but not touching   the molecules cause the diaphragm to move slightly  causing the magnet to move within the coil  causing electrical energy to be generated  which is converted into ones and zeros  those go down a cable  into whatever mechanism you are mic  ed up to  other types of microphone work differently  in that they do nt use a magnet  condenser microphones  the kind you see hanging from a stand in videos of recording sessions  use two oppositely charged plates  positioned ever so slightly away from each other  one plate is rigid  the other is the diaphragm  same principle  sound energy causes one plate to move  and the opposite charges cause electrical energy to be generated  converted  and sent down the wire  however  to get the plates to charge  you need to power them with electricity  condensers are far more sensitive and fragile because of the plate s distance from each other ,0
more than likely a supermassive black hole  this is what pretty much everything in the galaxy orbits around  we ca nt see it directly but from our observations of other similar galaxies we can assume ours is pretty much the same  also our galaxy is part of a larger group of galaxies called a super cluster  they do nt orbit anything specifically but are held close together by their gravity  as several users have said   a super  massive black hole  there appears to be one of those at the centre of every galaxy we ve looked at  so even though we ca nt directly see the centre of the milkyway  we re pretty confident saying that s what is there  what makes the stars spiral around it  well  when the galaxy formed it was like a larger version of when the solar system formed  basically a very very large cloud of gas  started spinning and collapsing under gravity  the stars continue to orbit in the same way due to a law of physics called the conservation of angular momentum  is our galaxy part of a greater orbit  like a super galaxy  not exactly  our galaxy is the milky way  but at the moment there are several dwarf galaxies in the process of crashing into our galaxy  there are also two nearby satellite galaxies  called the megellanic clouds  our nearest largest galaxy is andromeda  which is 200 million light years away  and both us and andromeda are orbiting a point somewhere between us  first i have to say there are two ways to define the  center   either the geometrical center or the center of gravity  for both the answer is roughly the same  either there is something  i guess by something we mean something with mass to it  or there is nothing aka empty space  sounds dumb but for the exact center that s all we can say  the more mass something has the higher it s chance to be in the middle of a gravitational system is  now if anything in our universe gets past a critical point of mass it collapses into a black hole  so it s most likely a black hole that is in the center  however in such a system there is never just one object determining where the center is  in our sun system for example jupiter is so big that he forces the center out of the middle of the sun so not everything circles around the center of the sun but around that point  that could be the case for our galaxy too so still all we can say is  there either is something or not ,0

most parents of autistic kids start noticing the signs of autism right around the time their kid gets their second mmr vaccine  which tends to make them attribute the onset of the behaviors to the vaccine itself  that suspicion gets validated when they go online and find all kinds of conspiracy sites proclaiming the dangers of vaccines  my best friend s youngest brother had a seizure following his second mmr  and then had a pretty severe regression in development  he was diagnosed autistic  and then later schizophrenic  it s very hard for a family experiencing something like that to not want to blame the problems on the vaccine  it s even harder to get them to trust vaccines again  they tend to discuss their suspicions a lot  so then you get a circle of friends who may also fear vaccines because  a friend of a friend had x happen to their child   people look at the lobbying influence of pharmaceutical companies and see that they wield a lot of power in the government  and it makes it easy to believe that there s some giant coverup happening  they question the importance of vaccinating against some diseases that have such low mortality rates  question the safety of bombarding an infant s immune system with so many different vaccines at once  and then worry about whether or not they re doing the right thing  parenting is already hard enough without also having to worry that you re either not protecting your kid from preventable disease or deliberately exposing them to a risk of autism  that doubt is what fuels the argument  a doctor said it once  so celebs jumped on board and made a bunch of noise  it s been pretty much established that the doctor had no legitimate evidence  he was even stripped of his license  vaccinate your kids  there is absolutely no scientific evidence that vaccines have a causal link to autism  the results in the paper that stated this could nt be reproduced by other scientists  and the doctor was later stripped of his license  he lied to further a cause  and people still believe it ,0
thousands of complex chemical reactions take place when i grill the perfect steak  i do nt have the slightest clue what the  maillard reaction   url0  is but i know it s responsible for creating beautiful burn marks on my steak and i know there are certain requirements that need to be met first in order to achieve it  like the fire has to be very hot  the steak has to be dry  and it works better when the steak is at room temperature  how do i know this  lots of trial and error and reading what has worked well for others in the past  the theory is that it was an accident  in the case of beer  it likely happened during the agricultural revolution when cultivated barley was stored and then infused with rain water and natural yeasts  someone must have tried it and got drunk and decided  damn  that s the good shit   they would have used natural yeasts until they found ways of controlling it  for example  sourdough bread is the result of this attempt at controlling yeast  bakers would mix water and flour and sit it out for natural yeasts to accumulate and cause it ferment  whenever they wanted to make bread  they would scoop some of this  starter  out and mix it with some more flour and water to make a loaf of bread  the long fermentation means a lot of lactic acid which is what gives the bread its sour taste  no surprise  bread and beer production go hand in hand  some of the earliest beers were made using bread  so  you control yeast for bread through sourdough  and then use the bread to control yeast for beer production  of course  because most of the yeast are dead due to the baking process   bread beer  is nt  that  alcoholic  animals in the wild can get drunk  and there are a few very amusing videos of drunk apes  drunk elephants  drunk giraffes and so on  they get drunk by eating slightly rotten fruit  old enough for the fermentation process to have started  early humans  of course  will have done the same  but also developed the capacity to start looking for ways to induce the process deliberately  instead of waiting for the fruit to start rotting of its own accord  over time  and with a lot of trial and error  and often  quite likely  just plain luck  they stumble over little tricks to make the process more efficient and to improve the taste  over time  all these little discoveries add up  and at some point  natural philosophers and  later  scientists  start asking questions like   but why does doing this result in that   in other words  the practice came first  the explanations came later ,0
nwhen discussing percentage changes it is important to consider the starting point of the change a one percent increase is not always the same as a one percent increase in the original valuennfor example if the tax rate in new jersey is increased from 6 to 7 this is a one percent increase but it is not a one percent increase in the overall tax rate this is because the tax rate has increased by 1 of the original rate of 6 which is not the same as a one percent increase in the overall ratennto understand why this is the case it helps to think about the difference between a percentage and a percentage change a percentage is a way of expressing a value as a fraction of 100 for example a tax rate of 6 means that for every 100 dollars 6 dollars is collected in tax a percentage change on the other hand is the difference between the original value and the new value expressed as a percentage of the original valuennin the case of the tax rate in new jersey the original value is 6 and the new value is 7 the difference between these two values is 1 which is the percentage change however this 1 change is not the same as a one percent increase in the overall tax rate which would be 7nnoverall it is important to understand the difference between a percentage and a percentage change when discussing changes in value a one percent increase is not always the same as a one percent increase in the original value,1

i remember reading something that pointed to not enough oxygen in the air to sustain them  i ca nt for the life of me remember the name  insects have an  open  circulatory system  they do nt have vessels that carry blood  they just have a sort of goo loaded with oxygen that circulates between their cells and within open spaces between organs and inside their shells  this is a simple system  but it is inefficient compared to a  closed  system with vessels  instead of being  pumped  from heart to the extremities  the fluid circulates by gravity  thermodynamics  and the motion of the insect s body  an  open  system has a limit on the distance the fluid can travel from the part of the insect where it is oxygenated to the furthest away cells in the insect s body and still deliver its oxygen payload  the amount of oxygen in the circulatory fluid is dependent on the partial pressure of oxygen in the air  so for every  of oxygen  there is a limit on the maximum size of the insect s body  at the modern oxygen partial pressure of 21   insects can be about as big as a human head  in the distant past  there was more oxygen in the air  perhaps as much as 40   at that higher level  insects could have larger bodies  the biggest insects could grow to be about 3 feet long   this is why animals with closed circulatory systems are so much bigger than insects  our hearts pressurize our blood  allowing it to reach the farthest cells in our bodies with oxygen  even in a creature as big as a blue whale  it takes just minutes for its blood to travel from its heart to the cells at the end of its tail  and back    birds would eat them   url0  before they got that much bigger than they are now  in addition  the larger something is  the larger its skeleton or exoskeleton has to be  and eventually that supporting structure will get too heavy to support itself ,0
a hangover is the unpleasant physical symptoms that can occur after drinking too much alcohol there are a few different factors that can contribute to the severity of a hangover and one of them is the type of drink that you consumennwhen you mix different types of alcohol together you may be more likely to experience a worse hangover because your body has to process and metabolize more than one type of alcohol additionally many mixed drinks contain ingredients like sugar and fruit juice which can increase the speed at which your body absorbs the alcohol and cause your blood alcohol level to rise more quickly this can lead to more severe hangover symptoms such as headache nausea and fatiguennits also important to note that the amount of alcohol you drink as well as the rate at which you drink it can also contribute to the severity of a hangover in general the more alcohol you drink the worse your hangover is likely to be,1
since the recession  more people in middle class have lost their jobs which pushed them down into the  lower class  bracket  the divide between lower class and super upper class is ever increasing  people who say this are being maudlin  middle income earners will always exist as long as there are at least some poor people and some rich people  what they mean is that facets of middle class life  home ownership  single  income earners  secure job  secure retirement  affordable education  etc   are disappearing  the middle income life of renting  borrowing  job  hopping  is more inline with the lower class of the 20th century  the reason for this is that purchasing power has declined faster than incomes have risen to off  set it   dying  is in the eye of the beholder  or forecaster    dead  seems premature  because the cost of living has gone up far faster than wages  add to that job losses most strongly hitting the middle class jobs and you get lots of people sliding into poverty ,0
whenever there is a loading bar  percentage the important things to know are how much you ve done and how much you have left  and how long those will take   sometimes this presents a relatively easy problem  other times not so much  for example  let s say you re doing your math homework and you have to do 100 problems where each one is 3 digits of addition  eg 253  412   if you ve done 40 of the problems then you are 40  of the way through your assignment  how ever long you took to do those first 40 problems  say  30 minutes  will probably be a pretty good estimate of how long it ll take to do the next 40 problems  then you ll need half again as much for the final 20  total of 45 minutes remaining   so  when your mom asks you when you ll be finished and ready for your dinner you say  45 minutes   this would be like being 40 mb into a 100 mb file download  however  what happens if you break your pencil and have to spend 5 minutes looking for a new one  finding a sharpener  you did nt foresee this but it affects when you are going to finish  maybe you wind up needing 50 minutes instead of 45  that would be similar to if your internet connection was briefly  but recoverably  interrupted  also  what happens if your friend calls and you wind up talking to them while finishing your homework  causing you to take a little while longer on each one  this would be similar to what would happen if your computer needed to download something else at the same time  sometimes the original estimate is just harder  for example  it s pretty easy if you have 100 equally  challenging problems of the same kind  but what if you re 40 questions in to a 100 question math assignment but you also have assignments in english  history  and science  if you have nt even looked at these assignments then you ca nt estimate how long they ll take  furthermore  if someone were to come up with an equation that tells you how close you are to completion it would be different for someone who is better at english vs someone who is better at science  this is the trouble that installation progress bars face  the computer has to do lots of different things and some computers may be better at some things than others  in the end computer users have proven to be pretty accepting of bad time estimates and progress bars that fill up unevenly as long as they can always see the bar moving  it s just not worth the dozens of hours it would take for a developer to work out a more accurate estimate   for most download time or simple file transfer estimators i just blame bad code  there are many ways you can estimate transfer time but there is very little excuse for the ones that jump all over the place   program installation on the other hand is really really hard to estimate  most complex programs have to deal with a bunch of vary different tasks during installation that are hard to estimate on every different possible os  even if you just set fix points in the code some parts will take longer than others and cause the bar just to pause for long periods of time on a slow system  now a days  you need to consider a progress  percentage bar as how much has been done  and an  estimated  duration  not how much longer an install  download  upload will take  also  installing applications requires a lot of cleaning up when the installation has finished  generally around the 100  mark   this is not factored into the installation progress ,0
one reason might be that people use cars more often and for shorter trips than they use planes or ships this means that the total amount of fuel used by cars might be larger than the amount used by planes or ships even though planes and ships use more fuel per mile another reason might be that cars produce pollution directly in the areas where people live while planes and ships release their pollution higher in the air or further out to sea this can make the pollution from cars seem like a bigger problem because it is more noticeable,1
sure taiwan is a small island country located in east asia china is a much larger country that is also located in east asia taiwan and china have a complicated relationship for a long time taiwan was ruled by china however in the 1940s china went through a lot of changes and there was a civil war between different groups the government of china was taken over by the communist party and they set up a new government in the capital city of beijing a group called the nationalist party who had been in charge of taiwan lost the war and fled to taiwan they set up a new government there and ruled taiwan for many years since then china has claimed that taiwan is a part of china and that it should be reunited with the mainland however many people in taiwan see themselves as a separate country with their own culture and identity they have their own government and elections and many people in taiwan do not want to be reunited with china the relationship between taiwan and china is sometimes tense because of these differences however there is also some trade and cooperation between the two countries,1
yes people can actually die of old age when people get old their bodies start to wear out and become less able to function properly this can make them more prone to health problems such as diseases and injuries these health problems can become more serious over time and can eventually lead to death its important to note that while old age can increase the risk of certain health problems it is not the only factor that can contribute to someones death many other factors such as genetics lifestyle and access to healthcare can also play a role in a persons overall health and wellbeing so in short people can die of old age because as they get older their bodies may become weaker and more prone to health problems that can lead to death however there are many other factors that can also influence a persons health and lifespan,1

a placebo is a fake treatment that is given to a person with the intention of making them feel better even though it doesnt contain any medicine or have any real therapeutic effect the placebo effect is the improvement in a persons symptoms that occurs when they receive a placebonnthe placebo effect is thought to work through a persons belief in the treatment when a person believes that a treatment will help them feel better their brain may release chemicals that help to reduce pain or improve mood this response can lead to a decrease in symptomsnnthere is scientific evidence to support the existence of the placebo effect for example studies have shown that people with chronic pain who are given a placebo can experience a reduction in pain even though the placebo does not contain any active ingredients that would directly affect the painnnto understand the placebo effect its helpful to think about the role that the brain plays in how we experience and perceive the world around us our brains are constantly receiving input from our senses and they use this input to create a mental representation of the world this representation can be influenced by our expectations and beliefs about what is happening to us when we believe that a treatment will help us feel better our brain may respond by releasing chemicals that improve our symptoms even if the treatment itself is not actually doing anything to directly affect our body,1

our nails both on our fingers and toes evolved from a structure called the claw claws are found in many different animals and they are used for various purposes such as climbing digging and hunting in humans nails evolved as a way to protect the fingertips and help us grasp objects more easily nails are made of a protein called keratin which is also found in other parts of the body such as hair and skin the nails on our fingers and toes are formed from the matrix which is the tissue under the skin at the base of the nail the matrix produces new cells which push the old cells forward and cause them to harden and become the nail we still have nails because they serve a number of important functions for us nails help us pick up small objects and perform delicate tasks such as tying shoelaces or using a keyboard they also protect the fingertips which are sensitive and important for our sense of touch additionally nails can be a form of selfexpression as many people choose to paint their nails or decorate them with stickers and other accessories,1
i think this is just a culture difference between america and europe  in america the majortiy of our sports are tied to a school  you usually start playing sports with your middle school and continue playing for your highschool and if you are good enough you play for a college  the players get scholarships and do attend the universities  they are hyped because it gives you a since of unity at the organization  you get to root for your school in a sporting event  correct me if i m wrong but sports in europe tend to be club based and have nothing to do with school  why we are different i do nt know but its just a culture thing  it s bizzare to me that you all do nt have college sports  1  people attended those schools or lived in that city so they have a strong allegiance to the team  2  more mistakes are made by players so there is a sort of  anything can happen  vibe  3  more fans more profit  so obviously people will hype whatever makes them money  college athletes gain scholarships from universities  they must pass all of their classes but they get a lot of help from tutors  in nearly all the states in the us  the highest paid government employee is either a head college football or head college basketball coach ,0

simply  because we teach them the names of the country as rendered in the language they speak  and because some countries  native names are not pronounceable by someone who has nt properly learned it the language â€” so they consistently end up mangling the name  example  americans who have nt learned a norwegian language before age 13 usually screw up pronouncing ã¦  ã¶  ã¥  ã¾  ã°  and so forth  so  when they try to pronounce svã¦rige  which is the native name of sweden  they do nt do it right  or the icelandic volcano eyejafjallajã¶kull â€” even danes and swedes have difficulty pronouncing it right  because the doubled l s sound like a mushy d  and people will listen to it  and reproduce what they think was said  because their brain literally ca nt hear the difference between what was said and what they think they heard  so  rather than teach all students every phoneme in the ipa  we stick to the names that are established  what do you do with countries that speak more than one language  deutschland is a perfect example  that s for germans  but germania for italians  same root of english germany that means land of the germans  allemagne for the french  alemania in spanish land of alemannis  ğñğ¼ğµñ‡ñ‡ñ‹ğ½ğ° in bielorussia  or from similar roots in other slavic languages  some of them come from the people that inhabitated from time to time that land and all of them have historical reasons which ca nt be wiped off just by teaching at school as they are part of their own languages this link even if in italian can give you an idea of how complex the question is url0,0
it only applies to d  d and games deriving from that  other systems have different ways of measuring it  the easiest way to understand it is to completely ditch the names  lawful  chaotic  good and evil all have a shitload of baggage associated with them  so  use different words  it s not evil or good  it s selfish or selfless  it s not lawful or chaotic  it s disciplined or impulsive  neutral  of course  means you are nt described as one or the other  but somewhere in between  you ve got the qualities of both  or partial qualities of each  so a lawful good person is one who favors disciplined approaches to things  and has a selfless outlook  they favor organization and structure  it s not that they re necessarily opposed to free  form and unorganized things  they just prefer organized ones  a chaotic evil person is one who favors a loose fit and looks out for themselves first and foremost  so long as they get theirs  they will leave everyone else to their own devices  and they do nt see the point in a lot of structure or organization for a variety of reasons  it s too restricting of new ideas or new ways of doing something  organizations always end up with tons of exceptions to their rules anyway  and so on  a lawful person is the sort of person who  when confronted with a problem  starts going down a checklist to isolate  identify and eventually eradicate the problem  a chaotic person tends to try one thing  then something else  then a third thing and so on  with no real structure to their probing beyond their instincts  both approaches can be equally valid  the lawful one may fair better in auto repair  but the chaotic one may have a better approach for hunting  a good person is one who favors assisting the most people possible with the least amount of effort  if they themselves have to take a minor hit  they re fine with it as long as the net benefit is good  something like a multi  billionaire looking to reform tax code as they believe it overly taxes the poor while not taxing the rich enough  for example  an evil person is one who does nt necessarily mean anyone else any harm  but they see nothing wrong with noting that a new cashier in the store is about to open the register and getting in the new line ahead of the elderly man with a cart of groceries and a stack of coupons and the mother trying to keep her kids under control  people who might benefit themselves and others by getting out of the store faster  they look to benefit themselves first and foremost  and rarely look to benefit others  a neutral  with respect to good and evil  person is one who looks out for themselves  but never at the expense of others  in the grocery example  they ll sit for a moment and wait for the cashier to turn the light on and see if anyone else notices before moving over  in the tax example  they ll simply keep their mouth shut and wait for someone else to fix the tax code  it s simply not their problem to care one way or another  in the organized  disorganized respect  it s someone who understands the need for structure  but also has a healthy respect for just doing whatever  it s someone who  when confronted with a problem  will try a couple of instinctual responses first and then try the checklist approach  most people are going to be neutral neutral  often called true neutral  as they do nt lean strongly one way or the other   now  the problem is that this system also tries to tackle maniacal overlords who kill babies and eat puppies because it s evil to do so  it also tries to tackle entities who would willingly lop off their own limbs if it meant someone else would nt go hungry that day  it basically looks at a selfish asshole who does nt like structure that much and a demon who likes to flay virgins and wear their skins as hats and says they re both chaotic evil  which is why it  uh  does nt really work whenever you try to say that a certain person in real life is acting lawful neutral  because you re saying not necessarily that they re somewhere between a saint and an asshole  but between someone who would give all of their wealth to the needy and someone who flays puppies  which is where pretty much 99  of humanity lies anyway  and  of course  all that being said  the alignment is supposed to represent someone s tendencies  not be a straightjacket for their every action  a chaotic evil person can donate to charity on occasion and still be chaotic evil  a lawful good person can curse at a girl scout and still be lawful good  calling it a straightjacket leads you to situations where you can make an argument that one person  fills all nine slots of the alignment chart   url0   the reality is that every person can fill all nine slots  it s just that a person tends to sit in one of them most of the time  i believe they re two separate things  i m not 100  up to speed with the alignment system but i think it goes like this  the first tells you how you feel about adhering to laws  codes  chaotic means you do nt care about them  lawful means you obey laws  these do nt have to be laws set by  good  people  these can be laws set by your evil clan  religion  your own personal code or what not  evil vs good is dependent on whether or not your actions do good or evil  so if your actions are evil but you strongly adhere to certain laws and do nt stray from them  you re lawful evil  if no laws bind you and you do evil  you re chaotic evil  if your actions are good but you obey your own laws  beliefs  you re chaotic good  if you obey laws and are a good guy  you re lawful good  the neutrals refer to people in between the two extremes in both cases  you guys are making it way too hard   alignment  explained like you are 5   url0 ,0
living in a rather stiff culture often drives those who decide to break out do so with gusto  a couple of reasons  one  they had a pretty much isolated culture for all of their history  but then ww2 happened and america jammed ourselves straight into their ports and refused to leave  causing all sorts of our pop culture to mix with theirs  but with none of the context behind any of it  so you get stuff like eating kfc on christmas being such a strong tradition you have to order your christmas chicken months in advance  second  while they are a lot more conservative on paper  the japanese tend to be a lot more comfortable with letting people endulge in whatever weird stuff they enjoy than a lot of the west is  as long as it s kept mostly to the people it concerns  third  most of the stuff we see is deliberately cherrypicked to be the weirdest stuff they have to offer  for every weird  ass tentacle porn video  there s plenty more fully normal things we just do nt see  if you want to know more about this sort of thing  you should check out gaijin goomba  url0   he makes a lot of videos about these sort of things  i believe it has to do with the westernization of the country  the younger generation feels more free  and tries stuff that they would nt do otherwise  as a way of expressing themselves  think taiwan  quite rebellious in a way ever since china lost complete control of them  they do nt really know how to handle that freedom and they try to create their image to the world of being creative and different  feel free to correct me ,0
time travel is not possible according to the laws of physics that we currently understand these laws tell us that it is not possible to go back in time and change the past imagine that time is like a river the river is always flowing forward and you can never go back and change the water that has already flowed past you in the same way you can never go back and change the past some people might argue that time travel is possible because they have seen movies or tv shows where characters go back in time however these are just stories and are not based on real science in order to travel through time a person would need to be able to move faster than the speed of light but the speed of light is the fastest speed that anything can travel and it is not possible for anything to go faster than that so while time travel might be fun to think about and can make for interesting stories it is not possible according to the laws of physics that we currently understand,1
emergency contraception sometimes called the morningafter pill is a type of birth control that can be taken after unprotected sex or contraceptive failure to prevent pregnancy it is not intended to be used as a regular method of birth control and should not be taken more than once in a menstrual cycle if you have had unprotected sex on multiple occasions and are concerned about the possibility of pregnancy it is important to speak with a healthcare provider as soon as possible they can help you determine the best course of action for your situationnnits worth noting that there are other more reliable methods of birth control that can be used to prevent pregnancy these includennoral contraceptives the pill these are pills that contain hormones that prevent pregnancy they are taken daily and are available in different forms including combination pills which contain both estrogen and progestin and progestinonly pills oral contraceptives are effective at preventing pregnancy when taken correctly but they are not foolproof and can fail if you miss a dose or vomit after taking themnnintrauterine devices iuds these are small tshaped devices that are inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy there are two types of iuds copper and hormonal copper iuds work by releasing small amounts of copper into the uterus to kill or damage sperm while hormonal iuds release a low dose of progestin to thicken cervical mucus and thin the lining of the uterus iuds are highly effective at preventing pregnancy and can be left in place for several yearsnnbarrier methods these are physical barriers that prevent sperm from reaching the egg examples include male condoms female condoms diaphragms and cervical caps barrier methods are effective at preventing pregnancy when used correctly but they do not provide as much protection as other methodsnnits important to choose a birth control method that is right for you and to use it consistently and correctly to reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy if you have any questions or concerns about your options it is a good idea to speak with a healthcare provider or a reproductive health professional they can provide you with information and guidance on the different methods of birth control and help you choose the one that is best suited to your needs,1
diesel is more expensive  the gap in fuel efficiencies are closing  i can get a 40 or 50 mpg gasoline car  who cares about diesel  then    and diesels do nt handle stop and go driving like gas cars do  it s that last one that disqualifies diesels for me  diesels are built with looser tolerances and take time to get to operating temperature  they incur much more wear and tear because you get in  start the car  go 4 miles down the road to the grocery store  and shut it off  then an hour later  you get in  start it up  go 4 miles down the road  and shut it off  again  and again  and again  for those in an urban environment  a gasoline engine is going to last longer  and my experience with diesels is that they re loud and smelly  my uncle has a diesel  and he has a pair of leather gloves just for gassing up  so it does nt get on his hands and stink for the rest of the trip  i thought he was crazy  until i gassed up his truck  then i learned to use the gloves  there are a number of different reasons ranging from blatant conspiracy theories to the idea that americans do not like diesel cars because diesel engines can not provide the same amount of immediate power that gasoline engines can  there s a couple reasons  diesel engines are loud  harder to work on  produce more pronounced sooty exhaust  and diesel is  for the last year or so  more expensive than gasoline  the last point is a matter of supply  demand here in the us ,0
the first computers were very different from the computers that we use today they were much larger much slower and much less powerful they also did not have programming languages or terminals like modern computers dornrninstead the first computers used something called machine code which is a series of instructions that the computer can understand and execute directly these instructions were written as a series of zeroes and ones which is called binaryrnrnto program the first computers people would have to write out these machine code instructions by hand using switches or wires to turn the zeroes and ones on and off this was very difficult and timeconsuming and it was hard to make the computer do anything very complexrnrneventually people started to develop programming languages which are like a set of instructions that are easier for humans to read and write these programming languages are then translated into machine code that the computer can understand this made it much easier to program computers and to make them do more complex tasks,1
a credit union is a type of financial institution that is owned and controlled by its members who are also its customers credit unions typically offer many of the same products and services as banks such as checking and savings accounts loans and credit cards however credit unions are usually smaller and more communityfocused than banks and they may offer lower fees and better interest rates on loans and depositsnnone of the main differences between a credit union and a regular bank is that credit unions are notforprofit organizations which means they do not exist to make money for shareholders instead credit unions are run to serve the financial needs of their members and to promote the financial wellbeing of their communities this means that credit unions may be more willing to work with their members to find solutions to financial problems and they may be more responsive to the needs of their customersnnthere are also some potential downsides to using a credit union for example credit unions may not have as many branches or atms as banks which could make it harder to access your money when you need it credit unions may also have stricter eligibility requirements for membership so you may need to meet certain criteria in order to joinnnoverall both credit unions and banks can be good options for managing your money and the best choice for you will depend on your individual financial needs and circumstances its a good idea to shop around and compare the products and services offered by different financial institutions before making a decision about where to put your money,1
great question it might seem strange that it is easier to carry a person weighing 150 pounds than it is to carry a tank of water weighing the same amount but there are actually a few reasons for thisrnrnfirst the human body is not made up entirely of water while it is true that the body is about 70 water it is also made up of other substances such as bones muscles and organs which give the body structure and support this means that the body is not as heavy as it would be if it were just waterrnrnsecond the human body is designed to be carried and moved around we have strong muscles in our legs arms and back that allow us to lift and carry things and our bodies are balanced in a way that makes it easier to carry objects close to our center of gravity this is why it is generally easier to carry a person than a large awkward object like a tank of waterrnrnfinally the way that you carry something can also make a big difference if you try to carry a person by lifting them up with your arms it will be much easier than if you try to carry them by holding them out to the side or dragging them along the ground the same is true for carrying a tank of water â€“ if you lift it with your arms and hold it close to your body it will be much easier than if you try to carry it with your arms extended out to the sides,1

most new cars have a feature called daytime running lights or drls which are headlights that are turned on all the time while the car is running this is a safety feature that is meant to make the car more visible to other drivers on the road especially during the day when it can be harder to see other cars the idea is that if other drivers can see your car more easily they are less likely to have an accident with you drls do not use as much energy as the full headlights so they do not waste a lot of energy they also do not cause the cars battery to drain faster or use more fuel in fact some people believe that drls may actually help save energy because they allow drivers to turn off their full headlights during the day which can save energy and extend the life of the headlights overall drls are a safety feature that is designed to help make driving safer for everyone,1

lots of energy to melt the snow  though it is done in areas where just pushing it to the side is no longer a viable option  the other concern is flooding and ice built up  when you melt the snow and conditions are still cold enough for it to freeze up  you just created a block of ice that is now going to block up any means for the snow to drain when the warm weather does return  if you melt the snow and the weather is warm enough not to refreeze  your introducing large amounts of water into the area which will drain into a body of water and possibly overflow its containment area  melting ice  snow actually takes a lot of energy  it takes 144 btu to melt a pound of ice  a gallon of gas would only melt an volume of snow 4 feet by 10 feet  2 feet deep  it s just not efficient  it actually is  though not in the way you re thinking  cities often put a layer of salt down on the roads before or after a snowstorm  salt water has a lower melting point than fresh water  so dissolving salt into the ice and snow will cause it to melt back into a liquid without the need for flamethrowers  as for flamethrowers themselves  or just hot air cannons   u  midwesterner64 covered it pretty well ,0
checkers and rallys are two separate and independent restaurant chains that happen to serve similar types of food such as burgers fries and shakes they both offer drivethru and takeout services but they are not affiliated with each other in any way its similar to how there are different brands of clothing stores that sell similar types of clothing but they have their own unique names and identities just like how you might wear a shirt from one store and pants from another you can also choose to eat at one chain for lunch and another for dinner its all about offering choices and giving customers the opportunity to make decisions about where they want to go for a meal,1

a strawman argument is when someone intentionally misrepresents someone elses argument or position in order to make it easier to attack or refute this is called a strawman because the person attacking the argument is using a weak flimsy version of the argument like a straw man that can easily be knocked downrnrnfor example suppose that you have an argument that says we should recycle more because it helps the environment someone might use a strawman argument by saying something like oh so you think we should just throw all of our trash into the ocean because its natural this is a strawman argument because it distorts your original argument about recycling in order to make it seem ridiculous or absurdrnrnstrawman arguments are a type of logical fallacy which means that they are not based on sound reasoning they are often used as a way to try to win an argument by making the other persons position look ridiculous rather than by presenting evidence and logical arguments for ones own position its important to recognize and avoid strawman arguments in discussions and debates and to focus on presenting and evaluating the actual arguments being made,1
camouflage on ships is a way of trying to make the ship blend in with the surrounding environment so that it is harder to spot or see there are a few different things that people can do to camouflage a shipnnpainting the ship one way to camouflage a ship is by painting it a color that matches the surrounding environment for example if the ship is sailing in an area with a lot of blue water and sky it might be painted a blue color to try and blend in with the water and skynnadding netting or other materials another way to camouflage a ship is by attaching netting or other materials to the outside of the ship these materials can help to break up the outline of the ship and make it harder to seennusing specialized paint some navies use specialized paint that can help to make a ship harder to see on radar this paint absorbs radar waves instead of reflecting them so the ship is less visible to radar systemsnnoverall the goal of camouflage on ships is to make it harder for the enemy to spot the ship which can help to protect the ship and its crew during times of war or conflict,1
the octane rating of a fuel is a measure of its ability to resist knocking or pinging during combustion caused by the airfuel mixture detonating prematurely in the engine higher octane fuels are more resistant to knocking and are therefore less prone to causing engine damage in general it is best to use the type of fuel that is recommended by the manufacturer of your vehicle the owners manual or a sticker on the inside of the fuel door should specify the recommended fuel type using a fuel with a lower octane rating than what is recommended can cause knocking which can damage the engine over time using a fuel with a higher octane rating than what is recommended will not necessarily provide any benefits and may even decrease performance and fuel economy jet fuel is not suitable for use in a passenger vehicle like a nissan versa jet fuel is a type of aviation fuel that is used in aircraft and it is not formulated for use in automotive engines using jet fuel in a car could potentially damage the engine and void the manufacturers warranty in summary it is important to use the correct type of fuel for your vehicle using the wrong type of fuel can cause engine damage and may not provide any benefits if you are not sure what type of fuel to use it is always best to consult the owners manual or a trusted mechanic,1

the answer is actually because glass cuts skin so much  better  than plastic  when you cut yourself  the platelets in your blood rush to the wound and pack up to form a blood clot  when you cut yourself with glass  or when shaving  the cut is so cleanly done that there s nothing for the platelets to grab onto and the blood clot is harder to form  a cut from something with plastic  or anything that creates a more jagged wound will give your platelets an easier time to do their job so it wo nt bleed as much  machinehead933 answered  why glass cuts bleed more  so i ll answer why glass shards are more sharp  glass is much harder than plastic  thus when you break glass  the very thin edges will stay very thin and not just fall off or bend or get rub off  they will stay thin and sharp  plastic on the contrary bends more easily  so instead of piercing through your skin  the thinnest edges will just bend away and after hitting on the floor a few times most of the sharp edges will just have rubbed off  glass shears in a way that lets the edges be sharper than plastic,0
net neutrality is the idea that internet service providers isps should treat all internet traffic equally without giving any special privileges to certain websites or services it means that isps should not be able to block or slow down access to any particular websites or services or charge more for access to some websites or servicesnnimagine that the internet is like a highway and the websites and services you use online are like cars driving on that highway net neutrality is like a rule that says all the cars on the highway must be able to drive at the same speed no matter where theyre going or who is driving themnnthe idea behind net neutrality is to make sure that the internet is a level playing field where everyone has equal access to the same information and opportunities without net neutrality isps could potentially block or slow down access to certain websites or services or charge more for access to those websites or services this could limit peoples ability to access the full range of information and opportunities available online and give an unfair advantage to websites or services that can afford to pay for better access,1
ad block plus is a software program that users can install in their web browsers to block advertisements from showing up on websites they visit if a lot of people use ad block plus it can make it difficult for websites like youtube and twitch as well as smaller websites to make money through advertising one way that websites can still make money is by using alternative forms of revenue such as charging for premium features or services or by using sponsorship or affiliate marketing another way is by using ad formats that are not blocked by adblockers such as native advertising which are ads that are designed to blend in with the websites content its important to remember that ads are how many websites are able to provide their content for free by using adblockers users are essentially asking to use the content for free without supporting the creators and the website,1
selling an asset is not earning income you are basically moving value from one asset the laptop to another your bank account so you reduce the equity that is value of all my electronics and you increase the asset that is your bank account in your case you never entered the laptop in some category called value of all my electronics so you dont have that to make a doubleentry against the temptation is high to call it income as a result depending on the reason for all this doubleentry bookkeeping for personal finances that may be fine or you can create a category for balancing and use that and realize the negative value of that account doesnt mean much,0
sure lets say you are riding in a car that is going around a circular track at a constant speed even though the car is moving at a constant speed you will still feel like you are being pushed towards the center of the track this is because the car is constantly changing direction as it goes around the track so your body has to be pushed in order to keep up with the change in direction the force that pushes you towards the center of the track is called centripetal forcennnow lets say the driver of the car wants to go faster around the track in order to do this they will have to increase the speed of the car however if they just increase the speed of the car without also increasing the centripetal force you will start to feel like you are being pushed out of your seat because the change in direction will not be enough to keep you going in a circle so in order to go faster around the track the driver has to increase both the speed of the car and the centripetal force this way you will still feel like you are being pushed towards the center of the track but the car will be going fasternndoes that make sense,1
there are several factors to consider when looking for a mutual fund to invest in here are a few things to keep in mindinvestment objective what are your financial goals do you want to generate income preserve capital or grow your wealth over the long term make sure the mutual fund you choose aligns with your investment objectiverisk tolerance how much risk are you willing to take on if you are comfortable with a moderate level of risk you may want to consider mutual funds that invest in a mix of stocks and bonds these funds tend to be more volatile than bond funds but they also have the potential for higher returns over the long termfund expenses mutual funds charge fees to cover their operating costs these fees can eat into your returns so its important to look for funds with low expense ratiosfund performance look at a funds historical performance but keep in mind that past performance is no guarantee of future results its also a good idea to diversify your portfolio by investing in a mix of different fundsfund manager consider the fund managers investment strategy and track record a good fund manager can make a big difference in the performance of a mutual fundits always a good idea to do your own research and consult with a financial advisor before making any investment decisions there are many mutual funds that you can choose from and the right one for you will depend on your investment objectives and risk tolerance when looking for a mutual fund you may want to consider the followinginvestment objective what is the funds goal does it seek to generate income or is it focused on growthpast performance how has the fund performed in the past keep in mind that past performance is not a guarantee of future resultsfees and expenses what are the fees associated with the fund higher fees can eat into your returns so its important to choose a fund with reasonable expensesdiversification is the fund diversified across a range of assets and sectors or is it concentrated in a few specific areas diversification can help to spread risk and potentially improve returnsits generally a good idea to diversify your investments which means not putting all of your money into one specific mutual fund or asset class this can help to manage risk and potentially improve your overall returnsits also important to keep in mind that investing always carries some level of risk and there is no guarantee that you will make a profit its important to carefully consider your own risk tolerance and investment goals before making any decisions,1
black light is made by creating light with a specific type of wavelength this type of light is called ultraviolet light or uv light for short uv light has a shorter wavelength than the light that we can see with our eyes which is why it appears black to us nthere are different ways to create uv light one common way is to use a special type of bulb or lamp called a black light bulb these bulbs contain a chemical called phosphor which is a substance that emits uv light when it is excited by electricity when electricity passes through the phosphor it causes the phosphor to emit uv light nanother way to create uv light is by using a device called a black light flashlight these flashlights use a special type of led light emitting diode that is designed to emit uv light nuv light is used in many different applications such as for sterilizing surfaces in hospitals and laboratories detecting fake currency and creating special effects in stage lighting and nightclubs ni hope this helps to explain how black light is made let me know if you have any other questions,1

nuclear power is a clean energy source because it does not produce any greenhouse gases or other air pollutants when it generates electricity it is also very efficient meaning that it can produce a lot of electricity from a small amount of fuelto make nuclear power we have to dig up a special kind of rock called uranium uranium is used as fuel for nuclear power plants digging up and refining uranium does require some energy but once we have the fuel we can use it to produce a lot of electricity with very little pollutionone of the challenges with nuclear power is what to do with the waste that is produced nuclear waste is very dangerous because it is radioactive meaning it can harm people if we are not careful with it however there are ways to safely store nuclear waste so that it does not harm people or the environmentso even though there are some energy and environmental costs associated with nuclear power it is still considered a clean energy source because it produces very little pollution compared to other sources of electricity like coal or natural gas,1
diplomatic immunity is a special legal protection that is given to diplomats when they are working in other countries this means that they are not subject to the same laws as ordinary people in that country and they cannot be arrested or charged with a crime unless the country they are working in agrees to waive their immunityrnrnthe purpose of diplomatic immunity is to allow diplomats to do their jobs without fear of being arrested or punished for things they do in the course of their work for example if a diplomat from one country is working in another country and they say something that offends someone they cannot be arrested or charged with a crime just for speaking their mind this is important because it allows diplomats to speak freely and negotiate with other countries without worrying about being punished for what they sayrnrnhowever just because diplomats have immunity does not mean that they are above the law diplomats are still expected to follow the laws of the country they are working in and they can still be punished if they break those laws for example if a diplomat from one country is working in another country and they commit a crime like stealing or harming someone they can still be arrested and charged with a crime however the country they are working in would have to ask for their immunity to be waived before they could be punishedrnrnoverall diplomatic immunity is an important part of international relations and helps to ensure that diplomats can do their jobs effectively however it is not a license to break the law and diplomats can still be held accountable for their actions if they break the laws of the country they are working in,1

off  brand  products are usually marketed by their lower price  companies that produce a copycat product expect it to sell because it costs less than a recognized brand  and is still similar in function or quality  the wager is that price  conscious shoppers are less concerned with absolute quality  and more concerned with value  they can be made with less expensive ingredients  or sold for a lower margin  or both  the opposite also holds true  premium products often taste better or are made of better ingredients than their more popular name  brand counterparts  they are also more expensive  people primarily interested with absolute quality in a product are the least price  conscious  and therefore willing to spend the most money  i used to work as a food technologist and used to design food for companies  the two responses below are both correct  sometimes it is a cheaper quality item  reflected in the price  they are made specifically for very price  conscious consumers who are nt fussy about the quality at that point in time  if a brand is associated with a product  take cadbury chocolate for example  you would expect it to taste the same every time and be of the same quality  when it is nt you may tell your friends  complain to the company  expect a refund  this damages the brand  when you get a bad quality home brand product  if you are unsatisfied  you simply think  well what did i expect   and if you complain to your friends  they will probably say  well you should have bought cadburys   in some cases  the home  brand no name product is actually the same as the branded product and it is only your perception of the product that makes it seem different  i live in australia and there are two major supermarkets called woolworths and coles  lately they have really flooded the market with their own labelled products  aldi also makes a lot of imitation type products  i used to make a very popular product for both the branded product and the supermarket  branded product  we put exactly the same ingredients in  if i asked people which one they liked better  they would pick the product that has been producing the product for 40 years  they have a relationship with this product  they would say that the other brand did nt taste as nice  if i performed a true blind taste test  they could nt tell the difference  in short  sometimes they use inferior products  reflected by their low price  sometimes they use exactly the same ingredients but can offer it cheaper as they do not have to spend any money on fancy packaging or advertising which is very very expensive  and this makes you think it does nt taste as good  in my country  denmark  many of the off  brand cheap products in stores like aldi are made by the same producers as the expensive brands  just turn the container around and look at the stuff in small writing   but i got ta admit  the off  brand nutella tastes horrible  and incidentally is nt produced by ferrero either  but bread  cheese  milk etc is the same thing just different packaging ,0

yes on taxes it depends on the other point as you already see from bens comment if youre both very western in your culture you may want to consider bens advice because while you will save money it may not be considered a healthy way to start a relationship  western culture tends to see marriage as more of a do it for love whereas other cultures may view marriage more pragmatically and take economics and finance as a major consideration for instance a friend of mine married his spouse and it was 100 pragmatic  considering taxes and laws driving most of his family insane because it doesnt sound very loving these were the exact words  unfortunately this created tension later on because family on both sides kept telling both of them that the other didnt love the partner and they used how their marriage started as proof  as surprising as it is to me nonwestern many americans are horrified at people marrying at the jop or other pragmatic ways even if it saves them thousands answering questions about relationships is very difficult because often the issue is less about money and more about culture  if youre both from pragmatic cultures where economics and finance weigh strongly and you dont see possible issues with family and really be honest on this point then consider the financial advantages,0
a soda can has to deal with a surprisingly high amount of pressure  a concave bottom is a better structure to resist the pressure than a flat bottom  if you were to shake up or drop a can with a totally flat top and bottom  the likelihood of it exploding is greater than with a concave base  it has the same kind of structural effect as an arch in a building  it keeps the can rigid and helps stop it blowing up when shaken  dropped  it keeps the soda from going flat  as anyone4apint says  it is to handle the pressure  take a flat surface and apply pressure to it and it bends  so your soda can that started flat would now have a bottom rounded outward and it would be unstable and fall over much more easily ,0
one effect of depression is a lack of motivation or ability to accomplish things  often  when you start antidepressants  your motivation starts to come back before your actual depression starts to get better  so  you re still just as depressed  but you finally have enough motivation and energy to do something about it  ergo  a spike in suicides in people who have recently started antidepressants  i do nt know how it does it  but keep in mind  the suicidal thoughts they warn you of are more likely intrusive ones  which means they do not necessarily reflect your actual desire to commit suicide  intrusive suicidal thoughts are thoughts that do nt really follow your pattern of thoughts  they pop into your head randomly  without reason  for example  you re walking along a path on the side of the street  admiring the cute little dog that is on a leash in front of you  you look towards the street and see a car driving in your direction  and then wonder what it would be like if you just threw yourself in front of the car  this is not a scientific answer but what was suggested by me by someone who went through a rough patch and went through antidepressants  note  rough patch lasted about 15yrs  this was not fly by night stuff   the big thing about anti  depressants is it s not just depression they hit  it s many emotions  the thing that kept my friend  here  was  it d hurt my family too much  and that was too scary  when he took the anti  depressants the  hurts my family  thing was also suppressed by the medication  all the  here s why i should nt  were pushed down  he had trained into a  i should kill myself  mentality and held back by an emotion that was now being suppressed  many suicides attempts  then things started to improve and he got through it  this is one persons opinion told through me as a non  sufferrer of severe depression ,0
there are several potential incentives for a bank to refinance a mortgage at a lower ratecustomer retention by offering a lower rate on a refinance a bank may be able to keep a customer who might otherwise consider switching to a different lender this can help the bank maintain a good relationship with the customer and potentially generate additional business from the customer in the futureincreased loan volume a lower interest rate on a refinance may make the loan more attractive to the borrower which could lead to an increase in loan volume for the bank this can help the bank increase its profits and revenuecompetitive advantage by offering lower rates on refinances a bank may be able to differentiate itself from other lenders and attract new customers this can help the bank gain market share and increase its overall businessreduced risk a lower interest rate on a refinance may reduce the risk of default for the bank if the borrower is able to make their mortgage payments more easily they are less likely to default on the loan this can help the bank manage its overall risk profileimproved financial performance by refinancing mortgages at lower rates a bank may be able to improve its financial performance by increasing its profits and revenue this can help the bank grow and expand its business,1
you may not have a good choice until you start that job 2000 is awfully low for a car so it could be very risky but you may not be able to get a loan until you start the new job i would talk to a bank or credit union to get an idea of how much if anything you could borrow at this time if you have a letter offering you the job that might help to get a loan there are dealers who will finance a very cheap used car for anybody but that kind of deal is likely to be at a very high interest rate and should be avoided you could wind up with a debt and no car one other possibility is to have a cosigner such as a parent or other relative that could make getting a car loan easy,0
ok  everybody has at least a piece of the puzzle here  but let me see if i can hash this out before my nyquil kicks in  if this turns into a pile of mush toward the end  i ll fix it in the morning  i promise  helix400 has the best info so far  thunder  snow is uncommon  but exactly how uncommon varies widely based on geographic location  here on the south shores of the great lakes  it is nt that uncommon with lake  effect snow squalls  it happens around here  nw pa  probably 4 or 5 times a year  i m going to do my very best to keep this as eli5 as i can  but call me out if i go too technical  so  lightning is the product of big potential differences  aka voltage  potential differences want to equalize  to use a universal analog  you have socks on and scuff your feet across a carpet on a dry day  you re stealing electrons from the carpet as you move  eventually  while carrying around this abundance of electrons  you touch something that has a  relative  deficit of electrons  like a door knob  and you get a spark as the excess electrons make the jump from you  to this electron  deficient object  the spark actually jumps long before your touch the doorknob  the spark can jump about 11 mm for every 1000 volts of difference between you and the doorknob  and they can be up to 3 cm long for a really good zap  that s almost 30000 volts  the  snap  you hear when you get shocked is from that spark  you make baby thunder every time you zap your girlfriend while wearing your favorite christmas sweater  lightning is much the same  thunderstorms move an absolutely incredible volume of air around through convective currents  hot air rises  cold air sinks   these air currents rub against the ground  each other  as well as against moisture in the atmosphere  in the form of ice  rain  and gaseous water   and they trade electrons  with time  a large enough potential difference develops between either two clouds  or the ground and the cloud base  that a spark can jump the gap between the two objects  lightning  now  really tall and fast updrafts do lots of different things to give these air currents lots of things to rub against to either steal electrons from  or give electrons to  they can hold more precipitation and dust aloft  they can create much larger clouds  and by moving faster  can also transport these electrons more efficiently  these updrafts work on convection  the surface of the earth is really good at absorbing the sun s energy  and by proxy  the air in the lowest 2000  or so of the atmosphere is really easy to warm up on a bright sunny day  the warm air at the surface starts to rise  because it s warmer than all the air above it  if everything goes smoothly  it will keep rising pretty much until it hits the tropopause  somewhere between 4 and 10 miles above your head  depending on your geographic location   the hotter the air at the surface  the bigger the temperature difference it will usually encounter as it rises  and so the faster it will rise  this is instability  if the air at the surface is relatively cold  let s say 3c  the difference in temperature between the surface and aloft is nt very big  so the warmer  air from the surface ca nt rise very fast  or very high  a really kick ass great plains thunderstorm can top out somewhere very close to 55000 feet above the ground  more than 10 miles high  even a really rockin  snow storm will very rarely be taller than 15000   this really makes it hard for the air currents in a snow storm to move enough electrons around  and do it long enough  to generate lightning  the most common exception is around really big bodies of water like the great lakes  lake erie absorbs heat from the sun  but ca nt get rid of it very quickly  if a really really cold pool of air moves out of canada early in the winter  and sits over the lake  the lake could be up to 30 degrees warmer than the air right above it  a really thin layer of air near the surface of the lake heats up and picks up a ton of moisture from the lake  then starts to rise in to the super cold air above it  if the water fell back to the lake right away  it would land as drizzle or snow  rain mix  as the snow flakes melted right before hitting the water in that warm layer of air  if the wind is right though  that rising air is being pushed over the land as it rises  so when it falls  it ends up over dry land where the temperature at the surface is still below freezing  this is the best case scenario for thunder  snow  you have the fast rising air  lots of water being held up in the air so there s something to rub against  the clouds can be pretty tall  10000  20000  in really butt kicking squalls  so there is lots of time for the electrons to move around as well  because the temperature difference is still not as extreme as if the surface was say  30c  it wo nt be as much lightning as a really good summer thunderstorm  but there will be lightning  and it will be snowing like hell  thunder  snow is  always  very very   very   heavy snow  or snow  sleet mix  the most intense electrical snow storm i ve personally witnessed was producing snowfall at almost 6  per hour  and kept up a total whiteout for more than 2 hours  december 2001  syracuse  ny   source  great lakes region storm chaser and weather weenie since 1992  depends on where you live  here along the wasatch front in utah  we see it multiple times almost every winter   this paper   url0  describes it more  i screencapped the us map for you   url1   url1   edit  this map seems to indicate we get lightning in a snow storm about once every three years  i can tell from experience it s more than that  i ve seen some snow storms in recent years send of dozens of lightning strikes  it has to do with the air being cold in a snowstorm  thunderstorms are caused when warmer air rises and mixes with the cold air  causing instability in the air  this does not happen as often when it is cold and snows making lightning strikes in a snowstorm less likely ,0
there is no simple rule like you cancant spend moreless than x per person instead there is a reasonableness test there is such a thing as an audit of just your travel and entertainment expenses  i know because ive had one for my ontario corporation ive deducted company christmas parties and goingaway dinners for departing employees without incident you know i presume about only deducting half of certain expenses if the reason for the entertainment is to acquire or keep either employees or clients there shouldnt be a problem  things are slightly trickier with very small companies microsoft can send an entire team to hawaii with their families as a reward at the end of a tough project and deduct it you probably cant send yourself as a similar reward if your party is strictly for your neighbours personal friends and close family with no clients potential clients employees potential employees suppliers or potential suppliers in attendance then no dont deduct it if you imagine yourself telling an auditor why you threw the party and why the business funded it youll know whether its ok to do it or not,0
the short and unexciting answer  is that we ca nt really answer that question  presumably the human brain would have evolved to represent these somehow  but it has nt  so we can only  pretend  to see them by essentially using technology to shift them into the visible spectrum  but some make  believe dust added and  if you can see radiowaves  then astronomical objects  your radio  your wifi router  technological stuff in general  will put out lots of  light   if you could see microwaves  well  the cosmic microwave radiation that fills the universe would presumably fill your vision with light everywhere  all the time  forever  i d find it kind of annoying honestly  it definitely would nt help you see very well  if you could see infrared  well  you d see akin to how infrared cameras present things  presumably  blobs of  light  dependent upon temperature  potentially useful in some respects  problematic in others  you could find a dropped cigarette pretty easily  your girlfriend s face would be a smear of light though  ultraviolet light is given off by stars  televisions  certain lights  you d have essentially some overlap with things that already light up for you  if you could percieve x  rays  you d see dim shadows of the objects they pass through  like your neighbor s skeleton  this of course would make seeing things as we do now kind of difficult  you would nt see anything different in the night sky from that though  as the atmosphere blocks it out  gamma rays would be visible coming from radioactive stuff  and from the night sky  if intense enough  i suppose they would pierce through solid objects near you  in short  it d be a real pain in the ass  because you d be overwhelmed with  light  that would not correspond to solid objects in your vicinity particularly conveniently   this   url0  picture gives a sense of how the sky would look if we could  see  in radio  and had eyes big enough to resolve celestial objects at that wavelength   the foreground is obviously a normal photograph but the sky shows all the radio  loud sources we would be able to see  note that the scattered points that look like stars are actually radio galaxies and quasars  of interest is that several animal species see other wavelengths  deer and waterfowl can see some ultraviolet but not reds  hence why people where blaze orange for deer   and i believe there s a shrimp that lives in the deep see that can see in many different spectrums like the friggin predator or something  url0 and more humorously put  url1,0

they re not entirely random numbers  the way it works  to simplify it a lot  is that each token starts with a unique seed number  and then that number is run though a complicated encryption algorithm which generates the next number  and run through it again which generates the next  and again for the next and so on  this is done every thirty seconds or one minute  the token has an internal timer that increments the number  basically what that means is  if the central database knows your token s seed  and it knows the encryption algorithm  and most importantly  it has an accurate time source  it knows what number your token should be displaying right now  there s no actual link between your token and anything  it s a totally self  contained device  it s just something you have to physically have in order to have access to your accounts  so it adds an extra layer of security  someone might have your computer  and have your password  but without the key fob too  they ca nt get in  the classic three level security mantra is something you know  something you have  something you are  something you know is a password  something you have might be this key  fob authenticator just for an example  and something you are is a bit less common  biometric stuff like iris scans or fingerprint recognition  or voice recognition  three is ideal  but two is better than one  basically the device has a secret password inside of it that the server also knows  rather than ever show that actual password  the device runs some math on it  using the current time as a variable  that produces an output  the server does the same math to check if you gave the right password for that time  this way  you never have to memorise anything  and you have to have that piece of hardware to be able to properly authenticate  it can not be scraped with a keylogger  because it quickly changes  math  it does a calculation based on the code you entered on the service you are using it for and also does something with that number and the current time  the code changes about every 90 seconds depending on the interval set  example  your code 123456 x 91700917am  that code will work during that whole minute  after that minute the code will change  it can be more complicated than that but as long as both sides know the algorithm and the secret code the codes will be the same at the same time ,0
it is considered meat  there are some people who say it is nt meat  but those people are wrong  fish is nt considered meat because english and latin are slightly different languages  for hundreds of years catholics were not allowed to eat meat on friday  but the language of the church is latin  and what catholics were not allowed to eat is  carne  which is the flesh of creatures from the land or the sky  so fish was fine  fish  meat  i m a vegetarian and some people get confused that i do nt eat fish   you re a vegetarian    yes   but you eat fish right    no  i m a vegetarian   some vegetarians eat fish though   nope  they re not vegetarian  ,0
serotonin and dopamine are chemicals in the brain that help regulate mood emotion and pleasure it is not necessarily true that people who are more serious or strict are less affected by these chemicals everyone has different levels of serotonin and dopamine in their brain and these levels can be influenced by a variety of factors including genetics environment and lifestyle some people may naturally have higher levels of these chemicals which can affect their overall mood and pleasureseeking behavior however it is not accurate to say that one personality trait such as being serious or strict directly determines how much pleasure someone feels,1
to answer your question in its entirety theres more information we need exchange session traded security order type etc most exchanges support partial fills that is your order will be partially executed and modified  in your example youd get an execution of 10 shares at 100 and your order ticket will be modified to 100 for 990 shares like john bensin explained there are ways to prevent partial filling through order modifiers eg fillorkill my addition here is there are also ways to prevent the other bit ie do the partial fill but dont keep a modified order in the system  youd have to mark the order immediateorcancel ioc  in your case youd be partially filled 10 100 and thats it  for the remaining 990 shares youd have to enter a new order,0
most us elections are for very unimportant things  very rarely are presidents voted on  and the less important the position up for election the fewer people show up  so if there is an election where the most important position is state or local office  very few people show up  even when it is a federal election  but the president is not being voted on  you lose the interest of roughly 15  25  of the country  when these  off  year  elections are added to the average the us does much worse  first  apathy  if you do nt care enough about an issue  you wo nt participate  a lot of people find politics and elected offices more boring than dirt  and wo nt take the time to learn about it  when you have a large number of your population that do nt know the types of jobs that are filled through elections  and do nt take the time to learn about the canidates  you get crappy judges and school boards that believe creationism should be taught as science  add on campaign adds that misconstrue a statement or outright lie  people start believing everything is a lie  and if you ca nt trust anybody to tell you the truth  why should you vote for anybody  also  the ammount of money being funneled in to campaigns means negitive adds everywhere you look  it starts to feel like you re getting hit on the head with a hammer  and you start to tune it all out  that is why i think turnout is alwasy so low  much of it has to do with the electoral college  conservatives in new york and liberals in oklahoma basically have no say in the presidential elections  so why even bother going out  also fyi you linked to the federal data both times,0

mostly because people  pay  the high price and the industry does nt suffer  however   you do nt have to pay so goddamn much   url0  it is a business model that s been widely adopted  they sell the razor handle itself rather cheaply  but then make huge profits on the blades  the blades are made to not be interchangeable  so you have to buy the blades from them  bwah ha ha ha  this model has been so successful that it was adopted by makers of inkjet printers  they sell the printers themselves quite cheaply  sometimes below the actual cost of production  and then charge very high prices for ink refill cartridges  there s plenty of good answers  but in short  yes it is a razor company conspiracy  you can fight the system by switching to shaving with an old school safety razor  check out r  wickededge if you re interested ,0
this seems to depend on what kind of corporation you have set up if youre set up as a sole proprietor then the solo 401k contributions whether employee or employer will be deducted from your gross income  thus they dont reduce it if youre set up as an scorp then the employer contributions similar to large employer contributions will be deducted from wages and wont show up in box 1 on your w2 so they would reduce your gross income  note employee contributions also would go away from box 1 but would still be in box 3 and 5 for ficapayroll tax purposes this is nicely discussed in detail here the irs page that discusses this in more harder to understand detail is here separately i think a discussion of gross income is merited as it has a special definition for sole proprietorships the irs defines it in publication 501 as gross income    gross income is all income you receive in the form of money goods property and services that is not exempt from tax if you are married and live with your spouse in a community property state half of any income defined by state law as community income may be considered yours for a list of community property states see community property states under married filing separately later selfemployed persons    if you are selfemployed in a business that provides services where products are not a factor your gross income from that business is the gross receipts if you are selfemployed in a business involving manufacturing merchandising or mining your gross income from that business is the total sales minus the cost of goods sold in either case you must add any income from investments and from incidental or outside operations or sources so i think that regardless of 401k contributions your gross income is your gross receipts if youre a contractor its probably the total listed on your 1099s,0
a distribution is a payment or transfer of money from an investment account such as a retirement account or mutual fund distributions can be made for a variety of reasons such as to fund withdrawals or to pay out dividends or capital gains earned by the investments in the accountwithdrawal on the other hand refers to taking money out of an investment account for personal use for example you might make a withdrawal from a retirement account to pay for a major purchase or to use as income during retirement withdrawals from certain types of accounts such as traditional 401ks or individual retirement accounts iras may be subject to taxes and penalties if made before a certain age its important to understand the rules and tax implications of making withdrawals from your investment accounts,1
the big xii conference is a group of universities that compete against each other in sports including basketball and football it sounds like you are asking why some of the universities in the big xii conference are leaving or considering leaving the conference there are a few reasons why this might be happening one reason could be that the universities are being offered more money to join another conference or that they think they would be more competitive in a different conference another reason could be that the universities disagree with the rules or policies of the big xii conference and prefer to be a part of a different conference its also possible that the universities are looking to form new partnerships or collaborations with other schools that are not currently in the big xii conference its important to note that these decisions are made by the universities and the conferences themselves and they can be complex and involve many different factors its not because any one university or the conference as a whole smells bad,1

so actually declaring war and breaking off diplomatic relations are two separate processes  you can cut off diplomatic relations with someone without declaring war on them and you can declare war on someone without cutting off diplomatic relations  in actual fact usually you cut off diplomatic relations with someone in order to warn them  and avoid a war  once war is joined that strategy clearly has nt worked and so you actually start to rebuild diplo relations  because you need them to negotiate peace etc  often you do nt want to lose face by reestablishing relations in public with your enemy and so the first diplomatic contacts will be secret  so for example kissinger s secret first talks with north vietnam  the un is different though  one of the great values of the un is that even when countries are nt willing to have relations with each other  they both have relations with the un  and so the un becomes a mechanism for enemies to talk  mostly indirectly  but occasionally ambassadors will chat in the corridors  or address each other in  through ga or committee meetings  edit  you might hear people talk about  track one  and  track two  diplomacy  track one diplomacy is official discussions between nations  when those nations are at war track one is nt really possible except by formal peace talks  track two is informal discussions  or discussions by non  state actors  ngos academics etc   on the state s behalf  most peace processes start as track two initiatives  there is no set procedure  sometimes they avoid each other  somethings they refuse to be in the same room to try to make people pick sides  sometimes they try to provoke each other  occasionally  they even act like adults and engage in diplomacy  they have to have their fellow representative buds with them constantly  so if they ever encounter the other warring country  they can make a big fuss pushing and shoving trying to get to the other guy while their buds pretend to do all in their power to hold them back  this way a fight never actually breaks out  no damage is done in the un chambers  however everyone s bro cred remains in tact  it s all basically bro theater in the un ,0
at the large university i teach at  kind of a football school   athletes are watched like hawks  academically  i m asked to fill out a form twice a semester for any athletes in my classes  giving their recent test grades  estimating a final grade  and checking a box  if the student is at risk of a failing grade   in addition to the supervision  athletes have access to free  highly  paid graduate tutors  at a special academics center which is restricted to athletes  and they re driven to class in large  multi  person golf carts  complete with a list of who they re supposed to be picking up    in short  my school seems to watch them and then throw money  perks  and special tutoring at them until they pass organically  for what it s worth  i ve never felt any pressure to treat athletes any different than normal students  except to allow them to miss absurd amount of class for games and travel   but i ve also never had a struggling athlete in my class  the ones i ve worked with have held their own quite well  they work their asses off  i went to a division i football school in the northeast  my roommate was a comp sci major and one of the nicest  coolest dudes on campus  he just had a way with people and everyone wanted to be his friend  by extension  i ended up befriending a few of the university athletes he used to tutor in his free time  these guys are probably the type you re talking about  they obviously did nt get in because of they were acing ap courses on top of being able to run 40 yards in 46 seconds  one guy my roommate tutored was overjoyed when he got a b on his algebra test after preparing all week for it  an hour each day for seven days and two hours with my roommate the day before  we all went out and bought him dinner to celebrate  the stereotype is that they take really easy classes  usually taught by professors who are big sports fans that grade leniently  but most athletes i ve met worked hard to keep their scholarships  they get a lot of special help  attention and are not allowed to slack off  some but not all take easier majors  funny side note  at my school the easiest classes often have football appended in front of the name  for example the easiest science you can take here is informally called  football physics  ,0
for most purposes they will have the same properties  until they start interacting with other things that are isomers themselves  you can imagine two keys that are mirror images for each other that do nâ€™t fit in the same lock  it â€™s more or less the same thing going on  but scaled down to a very tiny size  if they were the same molecule seen from different sides  then they would be achiral and would nt have dextro or levo isomers  unless you are mr mxyzptlk and can rotate the molecule through a higher dimension in order to get to that  other side   in a way mere 3  dimensional chemists can not  consider a pair of gloves in which the palm  side and the back  hand  side are textured differently  no amount of turning the gloves around is going to make them be the same as each other  one is going to be left  hand glove  and the other a right  hand glove  why ca nt you put a right  handed glove on your left hand  why does a left  handed person have trouble using right  handed scissors  why is a bad idea to dry on the left  hand side of the road instead of the right  molecules have to fit together  and a left  handed molecule is not going to fit into the same places as a right  handed one ,0
there are a couple of factors  remember that pain is a reaction in your brain  your brain is telling you something is wrong   and that our sensory experience  pain  pleasure  disgust  etc  is moderated not just by direct sensory input  having our pain receptors activated  tasting something  smelling something  but also by our cognitive biases and pre  conceptions  there s an old study where you give a group of people wine with either a cheap label or an expensive label  and ask them to rate the wine  the people who believe they are drinking fancy wine always rate it higher than those who think the wine is cheap  despite the fact that the wine is exactly the same  since they have an expectation that expensive is better  further  if you do brain scans and look at activation of  pleasure centers  in the brain  the people who think the wine is fancy actually  experience more pleasure   in the same way  seeing a cut makes expect pain  you know cognitively that wounds hurt  and thus actually intensifies your pain  by covering it up with a band  aid  you remove this intensification  that s why shots hurt less when you look away  additionally  light pressure on an injured area reduces pain  you know how you see people rubbing an injury  the stimulation of your skin  like from a gentle bandaid  activates a certain type of neuron  nerve cell  which intercepts the signal from the neurons that sense pain  furthermore  a bandaid is protective against accidentally hitting your injured area against something and  if it at all immobilizes  can limit the motion  stretching of the skin at the injured area to prevent hurting the area more  pain is in your mind  the reason your body feels pain is usually to let you know something is wrong  once you ve treated the source of the pain  by putting a band  aid on  for example   your mind decides that the pain is nt important anymore and ignores it  even if your treatment was nt very effective  this is easier for your mind to do with small pains than big pains  though  it s a placebo effect   once you know you have done something to it  it eases  this is why mom kissing your boo  boo helps and you do nt notice it anymore ,0

siamese twins also known as conjoined twins are two individuals who are physically connected to each other and share certain body parts they may share organs limbs or other body structures in some cases the twins may have separate heads and be able to move and function independently while in other cases they may be more closely connected and rely on each other for supportnnits not always easy to determine how siamese twins will divide up tasks and responsibilities it can depend on the specific arrangement of their shared body parts and how they are able to move and function some siamese twins may be able to coordinate their movements and work together to perform tasks while others may need to rely on one twin to do certain things for both of themnnits also important to note that siamese twins are not a single entity and should not be treated as such each twin is a separate individual with their own thoughts feelings and desires they should be respected and treated with the same dignity and respect as any other person,1

what this abbreviated balance sheet tells you is that this company has negative equity  the liabilities are greater than the value of the assets  the obvious problem for the company who wants to do business with you is that they are going to have a real hard time accessing credit to pay off any debts that they incur with doing business with you  in this case the recommended course would be to ask them put cash up front instead of putting them on account you dont really need to look at the income statement to see that they are currently underwater  if their income statement turns out to be splendid then you can wait for them to get their liabilities under control before you set up an account for them,0
a headache is not actually a pain in your brain  the brain tells you when other parts of your body hurt  but it ca nt feel pain itself  most headaches happen in the nerves  blood vessels  and muscles that cover a person s head and neck  sometimes the muscles or blood vessels swell  tighten  or go through other changes that stimulate the surrounding nerves or put pressure on them  these nerves send a rush of pain messages to the brain  and this brings on a headache  most headaches are related to  stress dehydration computer or tv watching loud music smoking alcohol caffeine skipping meals lack of sleep a bump to the head taking a long trip in a car or bus infections can also bring on headaches in some people  flu sinus infections strep throat urinary tract infections ear infections lyme disease  most headaches will go away if a person rests or sleeps  when you get a headache  lie down in a cool  dark  quiet room and close your eyes  it may help to put a cool  moist cloth across your forehead or eyes  relax  breathe easily and deeply  if you are taking over  the  counter pain medications more than twice a week for headaches  or if you find these medicines are not working for you  it s a sign that you should talk to your doctor  a headache is a pain sensed in the nerves and muscles of the head and neck  as well as the meninges  the membranous coverings of the brain and spinal cord   your brain itself can not sense pain  so a headache has nothing to do with your brain hurting  it is really a pain somewhere around your brain  being picked up by nerve endings located in your head  there are two main reasons why people get headaches  and doctors therefore classify headaches into two broad categories  primary and secondary  primary headaches are not associated with any underlying medical condition  secondary headaches are associated with medical conditions like infections  fever  head injury  hypoglycemia  tumors  dental conditions or increased pressure in the skull andor sinuses  sinus headaches   make sure you drink your water  a headache can come on from dehydration  dehydration can occur from simply being out in the sun too long or even vomiting  also beverages like coffees  alcohols  and sodas  even though they are in liquid form  can dehydrate you as well  so just making sure you sip on a glass of water several times throughout the day to avoid the dehydration headache  if the ache has already started  chug a tall glass and in no time you will start to feel better  too much blood flow can also cause primary headachescaffeine reduces blood flow in the brain  some pain relievers contain caffeine to take advantage of this effect  if you â€™ve been taking caffeine every day and you suddenly stop  you very well might be getting a visit from an incredible headache because of the increased blood flow in your brain and sudden change in your routine  soak a wash cloth with cold water and place it over your forehead  this might help the pain by constricting blood vessels  especially if you ache is coming from your sinus or temple area  as soon as the cloth starts to feel warm just wet it again  you can also try putting the wet cloth in a plastic bag and freeze it for a long lasting compress ,0

water flowing over the top of a dam can weaken the top and face of the dam  but can also cause scour at the foot of the dam  if flowing water weakens the dam s foundation  that can create a lower path for water to escape  the water at the bottom of the dam is at much higher pressure than water at the top  and any scour at the foot or foundation of the dam that causes a breach can be catastrophic to the dam  it is much safer to have a controlled release spillway  with a gradual slope and an outlet area filled with rip  rap  large boulders or engineered media such as stone  filled wire cages  that will limit scour at the outlet of the spillway  edit  spelling it depends on the method of dam construction  a lot of dams are just made out of soil  called an earthfill dam   if you have water flowing over the top of an earthfill dam  some of that water will trickle down into the dam  washing away the materials and weakening the dam  on the other hand  if the dam is made out of concrete  you can just let the water spill over the top  but you will commonly build a spillway anyways  just so that you can predict where the spill will end up  free flowing water over the top of a dam damages the dam  spillways are the method of controlling that flow such that it does not damage the dam  the issue in california is that the spillways were poorly built and not properly maintained  and the californian government ignored all warnings about them not being at risk ,0
yep  i use a set to shoot my internet upstairs to a old wd wired  only live stream box  they work great in most cases with some caveats  the 120 volt ac stuff going through your house s power grid is a nice 60 hz  or 50hz if you re outside of north america  sine wave  all these things do is piggyback a small high frequency wave on top of that  the recipient box just has  blah blah boring electronics junk  that filters out or ignores the 60 hz power signals and leaves them with the higher frequency signals which represent the digital stuff  as i said they work great  you just have to be aware that if there s any power line filtering between point a and b  like a ups  a power conditioning av power bar  or i m guessing a powerwall or something similar  will filter out your powerline ethernet signal  but most of us do nt have anything like that  within  our house  so it will probably work  the adapters will usually have some companion software that will test for that andor basic connectivity between the two  as well as let you setup some basic security etc  because this is eli5  i want to make a minor clarification  those kits can use your house s power lines to transmit your existing internet from one location to another  with the paired endpoints  your can think of your existing electrical lines like a really long network cable  you do nt gain any internet access simply by buying that kit   you ll still need to pay for your isp s service   others have already explained how they work technically  but i d like to point out you ve got a good risk that you re not going to get your full speed from them  it works fine for something like a tv or music player but if you want to max out your gigabit line you should run a proper cable ,0
you buy  100 bond with a coupon rate of 5   fantastic  a year later  you decide to sell and discover similar bonds have a 6  coupon rate  meaning g for the same investment outlay  they pay more in interest  what does that mean for your bond  well  it s less valuable  why would i spend  100 for a 5  return when i can spend  100 and get a 6  return  so  to sell your bond  you ll need to sell it at a discount  but how much of a discount t exactly  well  thankfully math can tell us  the discount is the present value of your bond assuming a  5 payment  future value of  100  and rate of 6   a bond selling as a premium is essentially the same scenario except a year later similar bonds have a  lower  coupon rate than the coupon rate than the bond you re trying to sell making your bond more desirable  edit  you asked two questions  neither is better  because the bond selling at a discount or premium has everything to do with current rates and the coupon rate of the bond in question  as long as the price is arbitrage free  you re happy  a discount bond is where you pay less than the maturity value of the bond  paying  900 when it will pay  1000 at maturity   premium bonds are where you pay more than maturity value  the best purchase will depend on how much interest the bond pays compared to the average market interest rate  paying a premium for a bond may result in a better than average return and is therefore a better deal  i m going to explain it using the example of buying one of two cows  let s say you are going to buy a cow that you know someone will pay  1000 for in ten years  and once a month you will get a specific amount of money from people coming to see the cow you buy  however  people will pay you  40 a month to see cow a  and  60 a month to see cow b you know that the going rate to see a cow is  50 a month  therefore  you would pay less than  1000 for cow a because its interest rate  basically the amount people pay per month  is less than the market rate of  50 per month  making cow a a discount cow  you would pay more than  1000 for cow b due to the same logic  making cow b a premium cow  reasoning for using cows  kids like cows because they go moo  edit due to not answering the second question  i would buy either one if the yield was what i wanted ,0
you actually get an email from amazon  asking you if you can answer the questions  usually a product you recently bought   my best guess would be that they think they are directly asked by that person  does nt make much sense  but so does nt answering the question with a bad answer  what s even more infuriating to me are people who give bad reviews for products without bothering to explain how it displeased them    i did not like this product  it did not meet my expectations  duh end    it s as if some people literally do not understand the purpose of language and human communication  because amazon asks people who have bought products to answer questions so some people just try to answer,0

sure id be happy to explain the difference between 2stroke and 4stroke engines to yournrnfirst lets start with the basics an engine is a device that converts fuel into energy which is used to power the vehicle a dirt bike is a type of motorcycle that is designed to be ridden offroad over rough terrainrnrnnow the main difference between a 2stroke and a 4stroke engine is the number of times the piston inside the engine moves up and down during a single rotation of the crankshaftrnrnin a 2stroke engine the piston makes two complete up and down movements during a single rotation of the crankshaft this means that the engine completes one full cycle intake compression power and exhaust with every two rotations of the crankshaft 2stroke engines are generally smaller and lighter than 4stroke engines and they tend to produce more power for their size however they also tend to be less fuel efficient and produce more emissions than 4stroke enginesrnrnin a 4stroke engine the piston makes four complete up and down movements during a single rotation of the crankshaft this means that the engine completes one full cycle with every four rotations of the crankshaft 4stroke engines are generally larger and heavier than 2stroke engines but they tend to be more fuel efficient and produce fewer emissions they also tend to produce less power for their size but they are usually smoother and quieter than 2stroke enginesrnrni hope this helps to clarify the difference between 2stroke and 4stroke engines for you do you have any other questions about this topic,1
the lower courts have been fairly unanimous at striking down same sex marriage bans  if the supreme court does nt hear the case then the lower court s ruling is the final say  so here is how our federal court system is structured  stay with me for a minute   at the lowest level we have trial courts called district courts  they are usually the first courts to hear a certain case  let s say that i am a gay person and i sue the clerk of the court in my city for refusing me a marriage license  my case  me v clerk  starts out in the district court  we have a trial  the judge makes a ruling  the judge rules in my favor and decide s my state s ban on gay marriage is unconstitutional  yay  if everything stopped here  gay marriage would happen in my jurisdiction  and the clerk would have to issue gay marriage licenses  but we are nt done  the clerk can appeal the case to the next level  called the circuit court  this court gets to pass their own ruling on the issue  the circuit court rules in my favor  yay  again  if everything stops here  gay marriage can happen in my jurisdiction  now  clerk only has one option left  he has to appeal the case to the supreme court if he wants a different result  here s where clerk runs into a problem  the main way to get a case into the supreme court is to file a petition for certiorari  this is a fancy way of saying  hey supreme court  take a look at my case  it s interesting and the states are all divided on what the law is  so can you settle this once and for all   the supreme court gets thousands of these petitions every year  they pick which ones to hear  usually around 90  150 get heard  what happened here  the hypothetical clerk petitioned the supreme court to hear the case to overturn the favorable gay marriage ruling from the circuit court  but the supreme court declined to take the case  which makes the circuit court s ruling the last word on the case  effectively  the matter ends at the circuit court s ruling  and the circuit court struck down the gay marriage bans  once a lower court has overturned the law  it s dying  the supporters try to appeal the decision to get a new ruling  if there is no new ruling  the old one stands  by refusing to hear any appeals  the supreme court effectively declared the lower rulings were correct and there s nothing more to see here ,0
often they have few if any to give  the thing is  fives are more versatile since they can break tens or twenties  but tens can only break twenties or higher  higher than twenties the next up is fifty or a hundred  so you re better off breaking with twenties and fives  2 20s and 2 5s  50  5 20s  100   considering most bills are nt going to need flat fifty as change  but say  4773 or so  who the fuck buys a large mocha with a 50  assholes  that s who   stocking tens does nt really make sense  when the registers are stocked after drawers are counted  those are the bills they get  most or all tens they get came from customers   for most of the business i ve worked for  the registers would nt have any ten dollar bills in them at the start of the day  still not quite certain why  but it was just always how it was  so  quite often  it was nt that we were hoarding all the ten dollar bills  it s just that there were none to be given at all  i worked cash control  and at the store that i was at  10 dollar bills were always losers  by this  i mean that if we started the day with  10000 in 10 s  we d end the day with  7000 in 10 s  every few days we d have to buy a couple straps from our bank and have them delivered  we never discouraged our cashiers from giving out 10 s  but i could see where a smaller business would run out pretty fast  especially if they ca nt keep a lot of cash on site for safety reasons  if you ve only got 50 10 s in the safe  then you do nt really want to give them all out too fast  because getting more might be a pain in the ass ,0
time does not actually slow down when you travel near the speed of light it just appears that way to someone who is traveling at that speed this is because the faster you go the more time stretches out for you imagine you are in a car driving on a highway the faster you drive the more the scenery outside your window appears to stretch out and move by slowly this is because you are covering more distance in the same amount of time its the same with time the faster you go the more distance you cover in time so time appears to stretch out and move slower for you does that make sense,1

easter is a christian holiday that celebrates the resurrection of jesus christ the date of easter is determined by the lunar calendar which is based on the phases of the moon the lunar calendar is different from the solar calendar that we use to keep track of the days of the year the date of easter is always the first sunday after the first full moon of the spring equinox which is around march 21st because the lunar calendar is slightly different from the solar calendar the date of the full moon can vary by a few days from year to year this is why the date of easter can vary so much sometimes falling in late march and sometimes in late april i hope that helps do you have any more questions about easter,1

it is not possible to travel faster than the speed of light the speed of light is the fastest speed that anything can travel according to the laws of physics as we currently understand them this is because the amount of energy that would be required to accelerate an object to the speed of light would be infinite and the energy needed to accelerate it beyond the speed of light would be even greater if it were possible to travel faster than the speed of light it might be possible to use this ability to travel through time this is because the laws of physics including the laws of time behave differently at very high speeds for example time appears to pass more slowly for objects that are moving very fast relative to objects that are at rest this phenomenon known as time dilation is a consequence of the theory of relativity however it is not currently understood how time travel could be achieved even if it were possible to travel faster than the speed of light there are many scientific theories and ideas about time travel but none of them have been proven to work as a result time travel is still considered to be a purely theoretical concept at this time,1
tolls are fees that are collected for the use of certain roads bridges or tunnels these fees are typically used to help maintain and improve the roads and other infrastructure that the tolls are collected for sometimes the government uses tolls to pay for the construction of new roads or bridges other times private companies may operate toll roads and use the tolls to make a profit even though we pay taxes to fund road maintenance and construction tolls can provide an additional source of funding for these types of projects this is especially true for major infrastructure projects that may be too expensive for the government to fund entirely through taxes overall tolls exist as a way to help fund the maintenance and improvement of our roads bridges and tunnels they can help ensure that these important pieces of infrastructure are kept in good condition which is important for the safety and convenience of all the people who use them,1
mankind has been using oil for thousands of years but we didnt start digging for it until more recently people have used oil for a variety of purposes such as lighting lamps cooking food and making medicine noil is a natural substance that is found underground in some places on earth it is made up of tiny drops of hydrocarbons which are chemicals made up of hydrogen and carbon atoms noil was first discovered by accident when people noticed that some places on the ground were covered in a dark sticky substance they realized that they could use this substance for different things and they started to dig it up and use it nas time passed people realized that there was a lot of oil underground and they started to dig deeper and deeper to find more of it they also found that oil could be used to power machines such as cars and airplanes which made it even more valuable nso in short people started digging for oil because they realized it had many uses and it was a valuable resource,1

basically too much salt can increase your blood pressure  bad  as your body has limited ability to remove it  the reason salt increases your blood pressure is due to a concept called homeostasis  say you have two water tanks with a pipe in between them with the level equal  if you add water to one  half that water will go into the other and the levels would be equal again  this is homeostasis  homeostasis also applies to the concentration of liquids  if you added salt to one of these tanks  a lot   water would go to the tank you added salt to  to correct the concentration  in this case the salt concentration pressure  oncotic  must over come the pressure of the fluids  hydrostatic pressure  to see a change  so if you add salt into your body  you increase the concentration of electrolytes  therefore more water is retained to correct that concentration  and increased volume  increased pressure  think about a balloon  as you fill it up with more and more air the pressure increases till it explodes   increased blood pressure  tried to keep it li5 as possible  first time not sure if that s a good job p i want to take a different approach  drinking salt water kills people  that is the fact  why  because nacl  that is what salt is  when its in water it forms two ions  na and cl   these two molecules attract water around them as they have a charge  so when you drink the salt water  these ions in your body attract water  they are more stable  happier  with lots of water surrounding them  because na and cl ca nt get into your cells as easily as water can  they end up actually sucking water out of your cells  that is why salt water can dehydrate you  the actual term for this area of science is osmolarity if you want to look into it more  but it does nt really get any more exciting than this   too much of anything is bad for you  on a more serious  and uninformed  note  i know that salt increases water retention which has a direct effect on blood pressure  it increases it and with it the risks of heart attacks  strokes etc    salt makes your body hold on to water  if you eat too much salt  the extra water stored in your body raises your blood pressure  so  the more salt you eat  the higher your blood pressure ,0
they let china host olympics a few years ago  which does nt exactly have a great human rights record either  remember that hitler had nt yet started invading other countries or mass  murdering people  there were already anti  democratic and racist laws in effect but nobody could yet have known how it would have developed further  honestly i ca nt cite exact reasons  but imo based off of knowledge from that time   and even after  anti semitism was huge all over the world  and always kinda had been in one shape or another  as far as the death  work camps  they were nt as aggressive or known about at the time and before the invasion of poland and subsequent war with both fronts  no one was concerned about germany   i m sure i m assuming a bit there  also when the allies saw berlin at the time hitler made sure everything publicity wise was perfect  i watched a huge thing on it a while back before the history channel became about pawning stuff  also good to know is that hitler either lied on the books  or covered up his manufacturing of tanks  planes  things they were told were not allowed after ww1  early in he was very careful  berlin won the olympics two years before the nazi party came to power  by the time the olympics took place  it was still several years prior to the atrocities becoming widely known  remember  80 years ago information traveled at a much slower pace ,0
stephen hawking was a famous scientist and author who was diagnosed with motor neuron disease also known as lou gehrigs disease when he was 21 years old this disease causes the muscles in the body to weaken and waste away including the muscles used for speaking and moving to communicate hawking used a special device called a speechgenerating device or sgd the sgd was a computer that was programmed to produce synthesized speech based on hawkings input the sgd had a keyboard and hawking could type out what he wanted to say the sgd would then turn the text into speech which it could produce through a builtin speaker or through a device attached to hawkings wheelchair hawking used a small movement such as a twitch of his cheek to control the sgd the sgd was able to detect this movement and use it to select letters and words on the keyboard it took some practice but hawking was eventually able to type out complete sentences and communicate with others using the sgd the sgd made it possible for hawking to continue his work as a scientist and author despite his physical limitations it allowed him to share his ideas and findings with the world and to inspire millions of people with his courage and determination,1
when you drop a weight all of the weight is concentrated in a small area so the force of the impact is much greater when a person falls their body spreads out the force of the impact over a larger area so it is not as intense imagine you have two pieces of paper if you try to rip one piece of paper in half with your hands it will be difficult but if you take a pair of scissors and cut the paper into two pieces it will be much easier thats because the scissors are spreading the force of the cut over a longer distance the length of the blades so it doesnt have to be as strong its the same with the weight and the person when the weight is dropped it hits the ground with all of its force concentrated in a small area thats why it can break the tiles but when the person falls their body spreads out the force of the impact over a larger area so its not as intense and the tiles dont break,1
in the united kingdom landlords are responsible for paying taxes on any income they receive from renting out their properties in the past landlords were able to claim tax relief on certain expenses related to their rental properties such as mortgage interest payments insurance and repairs and maintenance however changes to the tax system in recent years have significantly reduced the amount of tax relief that landlords can claimin 2017 the uk government introduced a change to the way that landlords could claim tax relief on mortgage interest payments previously landlords were able to claim tax relief on the full amount of their mortgage interest payments at their marginal tax rate however the 2017 change introduced a tapered reduction in the amount of tax relief that landlords could claim starting at a 20 reduction for those earning between â£50000 and â£100000 and increasing to a full phasing out of tax relief for those earning over â£200000in addition to the changes to mortgage interest tax relief the uk government also introduced a new tax known as the section 24 tax which further reduced the amount of tax relief that landlords could claim under this tax landlords are no longer able to claim tax relief on a number of expenses including repairs and maintenance insurance and certain other costsoverall these changes have significantly reduced the amount of tax relief that landlords can claim on their rental properties which has made it more difficult for landlords to profit from their investments landlords who are affected by these changes may need to consider adjusting their rental prices or finding other ways to reduce their costs in order to maintain their profitability,1
not that much of your sense of taste comes from your tongue  actually  a huge amount of it comes from inside your nose  when you eat  tiny food particles go up in the back of your nose  via your throat  and that s where you taste a lot of the subtleties of the food  when you pinch your nose you prevent food particles from getting up in there  which is why you tend to lose your sense of taste that way  holding your breath is similar  when you do it not much air flows around  so not many of the food particles get in your nose  your nose doe most of your tasting  you can only taste 4 sensations  sour  sweet  salty and bitter  the rest is all done with your nose  your brain takes the information your nose is receiving  the info your mouth is receiving and combines it to make the final taste you process  this is why when you have a cold food can often taste very bland  most of what we call taste is actually smell  when you re holding your breath  air carrying food odors is nt activating your sense of smell ,0
creating smart artificial intelligence ai for video games can be difficult for several reasons one reason is that video game ai often needs to be able to make decisions and react to changing situations in realtime which can be challenging to program for example if a player is controlling a character in a game and the ai is controlling another character the ai needs to be able to react to the players actions quickly and make decisions about what to do nextrnrnanother reason creating ai for games can be difficult is that it needs to be able to adapt to different situations and environments for example if a game takes place in a city the ai might need to be able to navigate through busy streets and react to other characters or objects in the environment this requires the ai to have a lot of knowledge about how the game world works and be able to make decisions based on that knowledgernrnfinally creating ai for games can be difficult because it needs to be able to interact with players in a way that feels natural and believable this can be hard to achieve because players can do a lot of different things in a game and the ai needs to be able to react appropriately to all of themrnrnoverall creating smart ai for video games is a challenging task that requires a lot of programming and design work and it can be difficult to get it right,1
wiping a hard drive completely can take multiple passes because a single pass may not be enough to overwrite all of the data on the drive this is because when data is written to a hard drive it is stored in a series of blocks these blocks may not all be used when a file is saved so there may be bits of data left over from previous files that were stored in the same block when you try to overwrite a hard drive with all 0s you are simply writing a new set of data over the old data however the old data may still be partially visible to someone who is trying to recover it this is why it is recommended to perform multiple passes or to use specialized software that is designed to thoroughly overwrite all of the data on the hard drive its also important to note that simply formatting a hard drive is not the same as wiping it formatting a hard drive simply prepares it for use by setting up a new file system but it does not completely erase the data that was previously stored on the drive in order to completely erase all of the data on a hard drive you need to perform a wipe,1
they re not saying  flash memory will only ever support 2 tb   they ve simply designed an interface that only knows how to address 2 tb of data  it s like having a parking lot with only 20 spaces  even if you only have 2 customers  you know you re never going to fit more in there but that does nt mean you wo nt be able to expand to a location with a bigger parking lot later  you know those forms that have boxes to fill out your name  and there s a limited number of boxes for each field so if your name is bigger than the number of boxes  you ca nt write your whole name in them  that s roughly similar to how your computer communicates with the sd card  each field in the message it sends is a fixed number of digits  when your computer wants to read a piece of memory  it sends a message with that memory location s address to the sd card  since we know the number of boxes in the form  we know the maximum number that your computer can fill in for the  which block of memory do you want  section even if we do nt have any cards that can respond to requests that have that form filled that high  the specifications specify that the interface for that technology has the ability to address 2 tb of storage  when they designed the specifications  they intentionally chose a limit high enough to cover what they thought would be the lifespan of that technology  think of it this way  you live in a midsize town  the highway across town for current traffic needs only needs to be 2 lanes in each direction  but you hope that your town will grow over time  so you leave space for 4 lanes in each direction  so right now your highway might support 300 cars per hour  but you know with 4 lanes  it can support 900 cars per hour ,0

hardness refers to the ability of one material to scratch another  if you take a diamond  tipped pen  you could write something into titanium  but not vice  versa  so diamond is harder than titanium  however  diamond is very brittle for many of the same reasons that it is very hard  so if you strike it in the right place  it can shatter  remember those  toys made of many small magnetic balls   url0   imagine you have a brick made of that stuff  now imagine the balls are molecules of diamond  it s  hard  because it s difficult to make a  dent  by pushing the balls around to different positions in one small area  but if you were to pull or twist or bend it hard enough it would snap apart cleanly into two  or more  smaller pieces  that s a hard  brittle material  now imagine a similar brick made of balloons stuck together by static electricity  where the balloons represent molecules of a material  toffee  let s say  that would be  soft  in that you could fairly easily push the balloons aside in a small area  to make a  dent   but if you tried to pull it or twist it or bend it apart you d find that it would deform a long way  into a very different shape  before you got it apart into two or more pieces  that s a non  brittle material  in these examples the  hardness  and the  brittleness  correlate to each other  but that s a limitation of the analogy  some materials are hard but not brittle  and some are brittle but not hard  for example  jello is technically brittle because once you exceed its limiting strength it breaks apart cleanly  if you break a block of jello the resulting two pieces will be close to the same shape they were before you broke them  and you ll be able to fit them back together like pieces of a broken glass  that s essentially the engineering definition of  brittle   on the other hand  mild steel is much harder than jello but is much less brittle  if you take a block of mild steel and pull  twist  or bend it apart the two pieces will be highly deformed  if you stick them back together the resulting block wo nt be close in shape to the original block  the way the jello block is  hardness and strength are typically characteristics that are compromised between in a given material  diamond is hard as hell  so it wo nt scratch  but is not as strong as titanium  titanium will scratch and wear like any metal  but it s super strong   this   url0  is what titanium looks like after rubbing against a harder blade steel ,0

there was an eli5 thread one month ago or so about that  i ll try to sum it up  so in your ear there are little hairs that vibrate when they are hit by a specific frequency  now there are also other hairs on the opposite side of these hairs  they are just there to somehow amplify the sound  sometimes these hairs have kind of a feedback effect  so one hair is vibrating so strong it s causing the others to vibrate too  ending in a chain reaction  after a time your brain notices this and tells them to shut the fuck up  that s why this ringing stops after some time  i thought that was just another part of having tinnitus  i ve got a beginning tinnitus problem and i ve been told it s the hairs just like zantary wrote that tells the nerve system that we hear sounds  when the hair vibrates because of movements in the air  this is the sound we hear  then it travels through the nerve system to the brain  and we hear  but too loud or high pitched sounds can damage the actual nerve  or the hairs  and make it believe it hears the air movements that we know is sound  and it sends the signals to the brain and i hear this  i think you actually mean tinnitus though  ps when i hear that sound i ca nt help myself to think of a small old fashioned radio volume wheel  like on the boomboxes  and then i turn the volume down and it actually helps lol,0

i m not an expert on blood but evolutionary features do nt always have to  benefit  the species they simply have to confer no disadvantage in reproduction compared to others  having a certain blood type means having a particular variant of a protein   in the membrane   of the red blood cells  in the case of the abo blood group system  the proteins are glycosylated  ie complexed with a sugar molecules  and subtle differences in the sugar chains confer the different blood types  in the case of the rh antigen or rhesus factor  the difference is in the amino acid sequence of the protein itself  there are a a lot more blood group systems than most people realize  it is my understanding that blood transfusions are generally matched in 8  12 different blood group types  but do nt quote me on this  i am a biochemist  virologist  not a medic   now it is important to realize  that   many of these surface markers can also be found on other cells    eg the lining of your gut or your lungs  most viruses that infect humans or animals are enveloped viruses  this means that the protein capsid protecting their nucleic acid genome is itself surrounded by a membrane    this membrane is derived from the the membrane of the host cell the virus was produced in and generally contains many of the other molecules commonly found in the membrane of that particular cell type    if you paid attention in immunology 101  you can see where this is going  take a nasty influenza virus freshly released by a epithelial lung cell  let s further assume that the poor host  let s name him derp  has the blood type a and sneezes you on unsuspecting derpina  who has the blood type b derpina s immune system now may not recognize the influenza virus as such  viruses are highly mutable and may change their own surface markers within a short  evolutionary  time beyond recognition  however  derpina s immune system may notice that the particle she just inhaled contains blood type b surface molecules  these can instead be recognised as foreign and the viral particle can be dealt with accordingly    from an evolutionary perspective  any individual in the past with a novel or otherwise rare type of surface marker had a fitness advantage over the general population  if that surface marker could be found on viruses endemic to that population    this fitness advantage obviously only persisted as long as the variant was suffciently rare  resulting in the co  existence of one or multiple variants in the same population  good question  i know hardly anything  but i think it may have only been an accident caused by early people living in different areas ,0
truck stops often sell a variety of items including knives to meet the needs of truck drivers and other travelers who may be passing through these knives are not necessarily intended for fishing although they could potentially be used for that purpose instead they are often marketed as being useful for a variety of outdoor or survival situations they may be used for tasks such as preparing food cutting rope or even selfdefense the large size of the knives may make them more durable and better suited for these types of tasks its also possible that some people simply find the large knives to be more visually appealing or collectible,1
hate to break it to you  but they do  rigor mortis  depending on conditions  animal health  size  temperature  etc  takes 2  24 hours typically  in processed meat  it s already in a package by then  sometimes  the process is allowed to complete  as it can actually result in more tender meat  when it comes to big animals  like cows  controlled temperature and electrical stimulation  contracting  relaxing the muscles so they do nt lock up  can be used to avoid or control it  it does but rigor mortis also goes away  so by the time the animal is killed  skin  cleaned  and then butchered it is gone  a body will go out of rigor not long after it has gone into rigor mortis  there s no real rule to how long this takes  but the process of going into and out of rigor only takes a few hours  additionally  once the body comes out of rigor it is nt going to go back again ,0
this is a really loaded question  but i ll allow it because it raises an interesting point  in the future  do nt ask about something and call it  ridiculous  and something we have to  put up with  in the body of the post  daylight savings time you want  its standard time that is the devil i think it s a case of never keeping everyone happy  here in the uk  lots of people prefer daylight saving  because it means it stays lighter for longer in the evenings  twice a year  when we change our clocks  there s a call to stay on british summer time  bst  permanently throughout the year  so that the evenings in winter can be lighter too  on the other hand  there s an equally loud call to not stay on bst especially from scotland where bst in winter would mean it would nt get light until after schools start for the day  some people advocate british double summer time  where we stay one hour ahead of greenwich mean time in the winter  and  two  hours ahead in summer  this was used for a short while in the 1940s  it would also mean we have the same timezone as most of western europe  and other people just want to do away with the clock change altogether  although they ca nt agree what time zone they want to stick to  if we ve got that many opinions in a little country like ours  i m sure your much bigger country has got even more opinions  it would be impossible to satisfy everyone ,0
tv shows have different directors for almost every episode because it would be very hard for one person to direct every single episode of a tv show it would be a lot of work and it would be hard for them to find time to do anything else also having different directors can bring new ideas and perspectives to the show which can make it more interesting for the audience finally having one director for every episode might make the show feel too similar and might not be as fresh and exciting,1

cigarette smoking is not immediately addictive for everyone but for many people it can become addictive over time this is because cigarettes contain a drug called nicotine which is highly addictive when a person smokes a cigarette the nicotine is quickly absorbed into their bloodstream and travels to the brain where it can cause changes in the brains chemistry that make the person feel good at first smoking may not seem addictive because the effects of nicotine are relatively mild however as a person continues to smoke their body becomes used to the nicotine and may start to crave it when its not there this is what can lead to addiction its important to note that smoking is a very unhealthy habit and can cause serious health problems including lung cancer heart disease and many other diseases its not easy to pick up this habit and its best to avoid it altogether if possible,1

japan is very mountainous  mountains take up the majority of the landmass  it s not easy living in mountains  population and not everywhere on their island is liveable  if you have a  big  city  with good job prospects  people are going to move to the city  then they stay  even more jobs  better prospects appear  so more people from the countryside or other towns move to said city and stay there as well  this goes on and on  large cities such as tokyo and osaka are technically expanding  taking over suburbs or what was once just farm land  it might be easier to accommodate within the large cities instead of trying to attract populations to more remote areas ,0

venice is a city in italy that was built on a group of small islands in a marshy lagoon in the adriatic sea the people who built venice were not just refugees fleeing from the lombards but also merchants and traders who needed a safe place to do business to build the city the people of venice had to create solid foundations for their buildings they did this by driving wooden poles called piles into the ground beneath the lagoon then they built platforms on top of the piles and on these platforms they built their houses churches and other buildingsrnrnone reason that venice has lasted so long is that it is built on piles which help to protect the city from floods and storms another reason is that the people of venice have always been good at maintaining and repairing their city they have also been very resourceful finding ways to use the resources of the lagoon and the sea to their advantage for example they have used the mud and sand from the bottom of the lagoon to make bricks and to build up the ground on which the city standsrnrni hope that helps to explain how venice was built and why it has lasted for so long is there anything else you would like to know,1
lobsters used to be considered a cheap and plentiful food source especially in the northeastern united states where they are abundant however as demand for lobster grew especially in the mid1900s the price of lobster began to increase there are a few reasons for thisnnfirst lobster is a laborintensive food to catch and process fishermen have to work hard to catch lobsters and it takes a lot of time and effort to prepare them for market this means that it costs more to produce lobster than it does for other types of seafoodnnsecond the demand for lobster has increased over time especially as it has become more popular in restaurants and as a luxury food item when there is more demand for a product the price usually goes upnnfinally the supply of lobster has not increased at the same rate as the demand for it this means that there is not enough lobster to meet the demand which can also drive up the pricennin summary lobster has become more expensive over time because it is a laborintensive food to catch and process the demand for it has increased and the supply has not increased at the same rate,1

a dividend percentage is a way to express the amount of a dividend as a proportion of the stock price for example if a stock has a dividend of 1 per share and is trading at 100 per share the dividend percentage would be 1 dividend percentages can be useful for comparing the relative sizes of dividends from different stocks or for comparing the return on investment from dividends to other forms of investment incomeits important to note that the dividend percentage can vary over time depending on changes in the stock price and the size of the dividend a company may also choose to adjust the size of its dividends either by increasing or decreasing the amount paid out to shareholdersits also worth noting that not all stocks pay dividends and the decision to pay dividends is entirely at the discretion of the company some companies may choose to reinvest their profits back into the business instead of paying dividends to shareholders a dividend is a payment made by a corporation to its shareholders usually in the form of a distribution of profits the dividend percentage is the amount of the dividend payment relative to the stock price for example if a company pays a dividend of 1 per share and the stock price is 100 per share the dividend percentage would be 1 if the stock price were to change the dividend percentage would also change for example if the stock price increased to 200 per share the dividend percentage would be 05 the dividend percentage is sometimes expressed as a yield which is the annual dividend payment divided by the stock price for example if the company above paid a dividend of 1 per share per year and the stock price was 100 per share the yield would be 1,1

as an addition to chris reas excellent answer these tender offers are sometimes made specifically to cast doubt on the current market price for instance a large public company that contracts with a smaller supplier or service company also public might make a tender offer below market price the market will look at this price and the business relationship and wonder what the larger company knows about the smaller one that they dont now what happens when investors lose confidence in a stock they sell it supply goes up demand goes down and the price drops the company making the tender offer can then get its shares either way directly via the offer or on the open market this is however usually not successful beyond the very short term and typically only works because the company making a tender offer is the 800pound gorilla which can dictate its own terms with practically anyone else it meets such offers are also very closely watched by the sec if theres any hint that the larger company is acting in a predatory manner or that its management is using the power and information of the company to profit themselves the strategy will backfire as the larger company finds itself the target of sec and doj legal proceedings,0
1  we do nt have a proceedure outlined in either the constitution or other federal law to enact such a recall election  only congress could enact such a law and  big suprise  they are nt keen to do so  2  even if we did  given the way that districts have been drawn over the last few decades  it is highly likely that we would get the exact same types of people in congress as we have now  no one in congress is there by divine right  we elected many of them as little as 1 year ago  all of the house and 13 of the senate   3  what they are doing now  however upsetting  is their exact job  they are fighting to pass the types of laws that their electorate wants passed  and not passing those they disagree with   the greater issue is that we as a population do not have a unified way forward  congress will always represent the thoughts of the nation as a whole   edit  spelling because we have a constitution  which describes how the government works  and we decided a few hundred years ago that having one person who just happened to be born to the right parents having the authority to control the entire country is a bad thing  so we had a revolution over it  we can  its called an article 5 convention  its the ultimate power check on congress in case they get out of control  essentially the states demand a constitutional convention and rebuild the government however the hell they want along the lines of the original constitutional convention  congress has no say on what happens  its never been done before  excluding the original convention  and the one time it got close to happening  in 1981  congress backed off for fear they would lose their grip on power and gave the states what they wanted  in that instance budget cuts  since its never been done before  no one is quite sure what would actually happen if it got called for as there is essentially no model except for the original convention  so lets say congress is totally out of control and is not listening the people of the country at all  the states call for a convention one by one and when the threshold is reached  congress calls for the convention  the states choose delegates in their own ways and send them to the convention where they discuss what s wrong with the governement and what amendments they want to fix the situation  once the changes are ratified by 34 of the states  the changes become part of the constitution and congress must abide by them  what would they change  you name it  it would probably on the table  including recalls and term limits  the kicker is that is no actual involvement by congress  the whitehouse  or the courts  the states take control and fix the situation  url0,0

proprietary software is software that is owned by a company or individual and is not available for users to freely modify or distribute this means that users are often required to pay for a license to use the software and are not allowed to make copies of it or share it with others some people see proprietary software as bad or evil because they believe that software should be freely available to everyone and that people should have the freedom to modify and distribute it as they see fit this belief is based on the idea that software is a form of expression and communication and that everyone should have access to it in order to be able to participate fully in society others argue that software development takes a lot of time effort and resources and that companies and individuals who create software should be able to charge for it in order to recoup their costs and make a profit they may also argue that proprietary software can provide users with more features support and security than free software and that it is therefore worth paying for ultimately the debate over proprietary versus free software is a complex and ongoing one and there are valid arguments on both sides some people may see proprietary software as bad or evil while others may see it as a necessary and beneficial part of the software ecosystem,1
while you re partially correct  the stock is falling for two main reasons  firstly  the shares were over priced to begin with  they were first sold for something like  38  when they should have started quite a bit lower like they planned on initially  secondly  while people still use facebook  and it generates advertising revenue  investors ca nt see how the site can grow anymore  the reason facebook is popular is because of it s simplicity  remember the fallout when they made everyone get timeline  changing things on social networks does nt go down well  think myspace  investors ca nt see anyway for facebook to grow it s profits  without losing huge chunks of users  they ca nt ask for a sign  up fee  the site will lose over half it s users  they can shove more ads onto a page  but that will also receive a lot of backlash  there is no positive way  yet  facebook can generate profit  that benefits the user  this is a great question  people bought facebook not because it was doing well at the time  but on the hopes that it would skyrocket in the near future like google did in its early days  this is what we call  speculation   they were doing alright  they are still doing alright  but not incredibly amazing  this is causing a lot of disappointment in the people that owned it and they are cashing out  another major reason is that the price that it started selling at   38  was way too high for a company in the position it was in at the time  i mean  would you pay  500 for an xbox 360 today  but people bought it on hype  not facts  and reality is essentially sinking in that facebook is nt a rocket ship  let s just back up for a moment    what is a stock price    it is a ownership share in a company  it is a small portion of the value of the company  if  hypothetically  a person wanted to buy all the shares in a company  that is at least the price they would have to pay  just as you would nt typically resell your concert tickets for less than ticket price    how do people figure out how much it is worth    how do you calculate how much your house is worth  you see what the going rate for the land is in your area  you look at the state of the building  you look at what the   potential   is for the property  and many other factors  well all these factors add up and you can get an idea how much  you  would pay for a house depending on how you deem which factors important  company stocks are a bit like that too  a stock price should  in a nutshell  represent the total of the company s assets  its future potential  its tax and contract liabilities and a whole bunch of other factors  now it is the future potential that people speculate on as  unlike assets  this can be more subjective  when it was floated  a lot of people were probably expecting facebook to haul in more profits and be a more viable business model than it is  this is understandable  as sometimes you never know what is going to happen  it has declined in price because it has nt delivered on those earlier expectations  thus  it is possible for a company to still turn giant profits and have their share price collapse because relative to what was expected of them before  they are not doing as well ,0
upvote for the use of kobe beef  you re out there playing on the playground and the big kid wants to play on your team  awesome  now you re gon na win every game  well  that is until you play against the team made of really fast kids  bummer  but wait  another kid wants to be on your team who s even faster than that other team  great  now you re beating every team  if you want to outrun them  you have the fastest kid on your team  if you want to outmuscle them  you have the biggest kid on your team  there s a problem now though  both of them want to be the captain of the team but there can only be one  who s captain  both of them say you have to pick one of them to be the captain  but you know if you pick one  the other ones going to be butt hurt and not want to play anymore  that s what happened  both shaq and kobe wanted to be known as the best player on their respective teams and had too much ego to concede their alpha male status  there s more to it than that of course  but that should give you the basic idea  i came here thinking shaq was doing something with kobe beef  i m disappointed ,0
in mathematics the factorial of a nonnegative integer n denoted by n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n for example the factorial of 5 written as 5 is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 which is equal to 120 the factorial of 0 written as 0 is defined to be 1nnthe definition of 0 being equal to 1 may seem a little strange at first but it is actually a useful convention that helps to make certain mathematical formulas work out correctlynnfor example consider the formula for calculating the number of ways to arrange a set of n objectsnnnn1  n2    nknnif we plug in 0 for n this formula simplifies tonn00  0    0nnif 0 were not defined as 1 this formula would give us an undefined result but because 0 is defined as 1 the formula simplifies tonn11  1    1nnwhich is equal to 1nnso in short 0 is defined as 1 in order to make certain mathematical formulas work out correctly this definition may seem a little counterintuitive at first but it is a useful convention that helps to make math work smoothly,1
if the earth were to suddenly start rotating in the opposite direction it would be a very dramatic and potentially dangerous event the earths rotation affects many things including the way that the oceans move and the direction that the wind blows if the earth were to start rotating in the opposite direction it could cause huge waves in the oceans and strong winds which could lead to widespread damage and destruction nadditionally the earths rotation affects the way that it orbits the sun if the earth were to start rotating in the opposite direction it could affect the way that it orbits the sun which could have longterm consequences for the planets climate and the way that the seasons change noverall its not really possible for the earth to just slowly start rotating in the opposite direction if something like this were to happen it would likely be the result of a very large and catastrophic event such as a massive asteroid impact or a major volcanic eruption,1

color has been used in films for almost as long as the medium itself has existed one of the earliest examples of color in film is the 1895 film the arrival of a train at la ciotat station by the lumiã¨re brothers which used a color process known as autochrome lumiã¨re this process involved placing a layer of microscopic potato starch grains each dyed red green or blue over a black and white film stock which would filter the light passing through the film and create a color imagennover the years various other color processes were developed including handcoloring twocolor systems and threecolor systems however it wasnt until the 1950s that color films became the norm thanks to the development of more advanced color film stocks and processes such as eastmancolor and technicolor today most films are shot and exhibited in color although some filmmakers still choose to shoot in black and white for artistic or thematic reasons color film has been around since the late 1800s but it wasnt until the 1930s that it became widely used in motion pictures the first featurelength color film was the gulf between which was produced by the technicolor motion picture corporation and released in 1917 however this film was not commercially successful and it wasnt until the 1930s that color film became more widely usednnone of the first successful color films was the wizard of oz which was released in 1939 this film used the technicolor process which involved shooting the film on black and white film stock and then using a special camera to record color information on a separate strip of film this process was used for many years but it was eventually replaced by more advanced techniques such as eastman color and technicolors dye transfer processnnin the 1950s eastman kodak introduced a new color film stock called kodacolor which made it easier and cheaper to produce color films this helped to further popularize the use of color in motion pictures today the vast majority of films are shot in color and the use of black and white is mostly reserved for artistic or stylistic purposes color has been a part of the film industry since its inception but the technology for capturing and displaying color images has evolved significantly over timennone of the earliest methods for adding color to film was the use of handcolored black and white prints this was a laborintensive process in which individual frames of the film were colored by hand using dyes or paints this method was used as early as the 1900s but it was not widely adopted due to the time and cost involvednnanother early method for adding color to film was the use of color filters this technique involved shooting the film using black and white film stock and then using color filters to alter the light that passed through the camera lens this method was used in the 1920s and 1930s but it was not very effective at reproducing realistic colors and was eventually abandonednnthe first successful method for adding color to film was the technicolor process which was developed in the 1920s this process involved shooting the film using special technicolor film stock and then using a complex process to produce color prints from the black and white negatives technicolor was used to produce many of the most iconic color films of the 20th century including gone with the wind and the wizard of oznntoday most films are shot using digital cameras and are automatically captured in color digital technology has made it possible to easily manipulate the color of a film during postproduction allowing filmmakers to achieve a wide range of visual effects,1

the troubles in ireland were a period of conflict that took place in northern ireland from the late 1960s to the late 1990s during this time there was a lot of tension and violence between two main groups catholics and protestants catholics and protestants are two different religious groups catholics believe in the pope and follow the teachings of the catholic church while protestants follow the teachings of the protestant church in northern ireland most catholics wanted northern ireland to be a part of the republic of ireland which is a separate country while most protestants wanted northern ireland to remain a part of the united kingdom which is made up of england scotland wales and northern ireland because of these differences there were often clashes and fights between the two groups the conflict was fueled by a number of other issues including discrimination against catholics political tensions and the actions of terrorist groups on both sides the troubles were a very difficult and violent time for the people of northern ireland and there were many deaths and injuries as a result of the conflict eventually a peace agreement was reached which helped to bring an end to the violence and allowed the people of northern ireland to begin rebuilding their lives and communities,1

genetics  in my case i have them all day  every day  a couple years ago i went to a doctor and asked him about it  and he referred me to a doctor specializing in reconstructive surgery for people who have suffered burns  severe injuries  etc on their face  he looked at me and explained that the muscles on the lower part of my eye orbital bone was weak and thus sagging  forcing the skin to sag and blood to  pool  which caused the darkness  surgery would be needed to cut open and  peel back  my lower eye skin  tighten the muscle  and then put the skin back on in a tighter form  the name of the procedure is   blepharoplasty   edit  info added hopefully this is nt too late to be seen  i have them  my sisters have them and my mom has them  well we all had them  freeze 2 spoons and flip them over and put them on your eyelids for 15 minutes a day  what i m told is that blood is nt getting to it so by freezing them  your body will naturally react to it and after the spoon is off  blood will rush to them  sounds weird but trust me  it works  i too have a terrible case of buscemi syndrome ,0

correct me if i m wrong  but the op is not asking how fresh physical money is introduced into circulation  but rather how a greater number of dollars is introduced into the system  for example  if the gdp of the us in 1980 was  27 trillion and the gdp in 2010 was  145 trillion  where did that extra  12 trillion come from and how was it introduced into the economy  the federal reserve lends cash out to banks in the form of loans  this increases the amount of money in the system  which is what you may have been referring to by  prints money    the federal reserve has special powers by law  they can simply declare that they now have  x dollars  and it will be so  by loaning it out to a bank there is essentially an additional  x dollars  floating around in the system  the bank will then use this money to provide loans to home  owners in the form of a mortgage  or will otherwise spread it by spending it on other investments  and eventually the money will find its way into your pocket   if you re talking about how they physically replace outdated currency with new currency  in my country  i believe it is similar in the us  many banks do not have a central safe where they keep their massive cash reserves  each bank branch will hold a certain amount of money so that they can fulfil their needs from day to day  however most of the money is sent to the federal reserve which will hold the money  safely  on their behalf in their own reserves  hence the  reserve  part of its name   this makes things easier for banks because if someone transfers funds from one bank account to another electronically  the banks do not need to physically send the cash to the other bank  instead the federal reserve will be informed and the cash will just be re  allocated to that particular bank essentially instantaneously  since a large amount of money flows through the federal reserve itself in this system  they are easily able to replace outdated currency coming in with newer currency  in addition  i believe the federal reserve is able to negotiate with individual banks for them to put aside certain outdated currency which they will then replace with new currency  the federal reserve exchanges cash daily with various banks that further distribute it throughout the system  the cash collected by the fed is shredded  as it was discovered that burning cash releases toxic smoke ,0
it s worth also noting how  heat pipes   url2  work to carry the heat away from the small surface of the cpu and deliver it to the huge surface of the cooling fins  if you look at a  cross  section of a heat pipe   url3  you can see that it is hollow in the middle  and has a porous material on the inner surface  a small amount of liquid is sealed inside the heat pipe  and all air is removed leaving otherwise only vacuum inside  the liquid has a specific boiling temperature  so that the part of the liquid closest to the hot surface of the cpu boils into gas which then expands filling the middle part  carrying the heat with it  at the cooler end where the fins are connected  the gas condenses back into a liquid as it cools  and then gets carried by the  capillary action   url0  of the small holes in the porous surface material coating the inside of the pipe  which acts like a wick  back to the source of the heat  since heat pipes used in typical cpu coolers rely on capillary action  and not gravity to move the liquid  they can work in any orientation  including upside down  using a phase transition of a liquid  evaporation and condensation  to transfer heat is much more efficient than just using a solid thermal conductor  metal   which was typical in the  earlier cpu heatsinks   url1  without heat pipes  computer processors can produce quite a lot of heat  heatsinks are designed to help move that heat away from the processor  otherwise they ll get too hot and can be damaged  the plate at the bottom is attached to the processor and conducts heat away from the processor through the heat pipes on the side to the tower of fins  the heat from the fins then moves into the air and is ultimately exhausted from the computer case  the tower is made of fins so that it can move heat into the air quickly  if it were a solid block of metal it could hold more heat but would eventually heat up as it ca nt get rid of heat as fast  and then would nt do a very good job of moving heat away from the processor  the greater surface area of the fins allows more contact with the air  so there s more air available to move heat away  these things are air cooled  as in  they depend on air to take heat away from them  to work well  they need to be touching a lot of air at the same time  an example of large surface area helping cooling is putting hot soup in a saucer vs putting it in a tall mug  the saucer allows more soup to touch the air  and cools it faster  the design of these heatsinks has a large number of plates with gaps in between them  increasing total air contact area  heat arrives from the cpu through the pipes that are passing across the plates  air passes through these gaps in the plates and cools it down quickly  blowing air over the soup saucer helps too  this is where cpu cooler fans come in ,0
rubbing your face with your hands feels amazing when youre tired because it can stimulate blood flow to your skin and muscles when you rub your face you are applying pressure and movement to the skin and muscles which can help to relax them this can feel especially good if you have been feeling tense or have been experiencing muscle tension in your face additionally the sensation of touch can be soothing and can help to reduce stress and promote relaxation so when you rub your face with your hands you are likely feeling the benefits of increased blood flow and relaxation,1
our jaws have actually gotten smaller as we have evolved  along with the fact that we no longer have use for them as we can keep our teeth healthier and learned how to cook  as the wisdom teeth come in  they get impacted now because most people do not have the room in their mouth for them to properly grow in  which is why it is common practice to remove them now before they completely grow  some people do nt even have wisdom teeth because we have no use for them  it s actually a good argument in evolution s favor  i asked a dentist about this once  he said that back before we have modern dentistry  and our diet was a lot rougher  meaning  we ate a lot more food that was tougher to chew   wisdom teeth  and our teeth in general  got worn down a lot more  so it was nt so crowded in our mouths  on the contrary  i never got any wisdom teeth  not even roots  a dentist explained to me that this was a sign of evolution  i took that with a grain of salt seeing how he s a dentist but who knows ,0

protein folding is a natural process that happens inside cells  so scientists are really interested in it  because if they can understand everything that happens during protein folding  they get a much better view of how our body works in general  the problem is that protein folding is really really really complex  the best that we can do for now is computer simulations of it  which of course are very hard to compute and require lots of computer power to do  foldinghome is the best solution to this problem where they need lots of computer power  but do nt have a supercomputer running full time to help  the people who run the project divide the big problem into many smaller sub  problems  and distribute it to many voluntary participants  when you take part in it  your computer receives one of these problems to crack  and does it  then it sends the solution back  the more people participating  the more little pieces of the puzzle are solved  and the closer the scientists are to having a better understanding of how protein folding works  foldinghome is a program that you can download onto your computer  this program links your computer to stanford university s  and other user s  computers  stanford can then use part of all of those users  computers to help them simulate the folding of proteins at a faster rate then they could using only their own  when they are being made  proteins fold in different ways to form into different things  sometimes when they fold they mess up  this can lead to diseases such as alzheimer s  als  huntington s  parkinson s disease  and many cancers  by lending some of your computer s power to stanford for their reasearch  it allows them to run more simulations at once  which in turn means more data for them to analyze  which they then use to try to combat all of the diseases mentioned above and more  pretend you had to quickly summarize a book  instead of reading the entire thing and writing down the summary  which could take days   you split the book into individual chapters  and give each of your friends a chapter to take home to read and summarize  the next day  you take each of their summaries and add them together ,0
simple explanation  picture standing in front of a clock and looking at the face  then you start to accelerate away from the clock going faster and faster until you approach the speed of light  as you near the speed of light  the speed differential between you and the photons gets smaller and smaller  the photons reflecting off the face of the clock start to arrive in your vision slower and slower  the movement of the hands of the clock get slower and slower until you match the speed of light  then they stand still  so  in other words  your perception of your departure point eventually reaches zero time passage  while your subjective time continues normally  really eli5  basically  you have a set  speed  with which you can move through the universe  as it turns out  that speed can either be actual acceleration  like how gravity accelerates you to the ground if you fall  or it can be motion through time  so if you arnt physically accelerating towards anything  like the earth  you ll be moving much faster through time  if on the other hand  you started accelerating towards the speed of light on a rocket  most of your  speed  will be directed towards motion and not time  the universe gives you movement vouchers and insists that they be spent at a constant rate  you can choose to spend them on moving through space or moving through time  the more you spend on one  the less you can spend on the other  if you spend them all on moving through space then time stops  if you spend them all on time  then you ca nt go anywhere ,0

crack cocaine is a form of cocaine that is made by mixing powder cocaine with water and baking soda or ammonia it is called crack because it makes a cracking sound when it is heated crack is typically made in small batches so drug dealers can sell it in smaller quantities for a higher price it is also more potent than powder cocaine so people who use it need to use less of it to get the same effect this means that drug dealers can make more money by selling crack than they could by selling the same amount of powder cocaine,1

a space elevator is a hypothetical structure that would extend from the surface of the earth to beyond geostationary orbit allowing objects to be lifted from the surface of the earth to space without the need for rocket propulsion the idea is that a cable or tether anchored to the earths surface would be anchored to a stationary object such as a satellite in space an object attached to the tether could then be lifted into space by simply climbing the tether the idea of a space elevator has been around for a long time and while it is an interesting concept there are still many technical challenges that need to be overcome before such a structure could be built one of the main challenges is finding materials that are strong enough and light enough to construct the tether which would need to be tens of thousands of kilometers long as for the question of whether a space elevator could have a potentially catastrophic effect on the earths rotation the answer is no the space elevator would be anchored to the earths surface so it would not be able to exert any significant force on the earths rotation the centrifugal force that the space elevator would experience due to the earths rotation would be very small and would not have any noticeable effect on the earths rotation in short a space elevator would not have a catastrophic effect on the earths rotation because it would not be able to exert a significant force on the earth while the concept of a space elevator is interesting it is still a long way off from being a practical reality due to the many technical challenges that need to be overcome,1
great question there are a few reasons why the government might give tax cuts to the rich one reason is that the government believes that if the rich have more money they will invest it in ways that will create jobs and help the economy grow this could include starting new businesses expanding existing ones or investing in things like stocks and real estateanother reason is that the government might want to encourage certain types of behavior such as saving and investing by giving tax breaks to people who do those things for example the government might give a tax break to someone who invests in a retirement account because saving for retirement is seen as a good thing that helps people be financially secure when they are olderits also possible that the government gives tax cuts to the rich because they have more political power and are better able to lobby for favorable policiesoverall the idea behind giving tax cuts to the rich is that it will have a positive effect on the economy and society as a whole however some people argue that it would be more fair and beneficial to give tax cuts to middle and lower income people since they are more likely to spend the extra money and stimulate economic activity,1

i was born in nyc and my family lived there until i was about 5  when we moved to nj  suburbs  better schools  various ridiculous reasons   still  i spent as much time in nyc as possible  i ve spent whole summers working in the city and i feel like that may qualify me to answer this question  simply put  new york city is the greatest city i ve ever been to  i ve been to many cities across the world and have lived in both boston and los angeles for an extended period of time   there s a great deal of pride that comes with being a new yorker  there s a shared culture  an attitude  and  unsurprisingly  when people from jersey try and tell people where they re from or where they live  a lot of them just say  new york   to a real new yorker  this is entirely unacceptable  along with that  there are certain stigmas that go along with new jersey  there s the idea that it s dirty and horrible and the people ca nt drive  this is largely a result of new yorkers only really ever seeing nj when they come to watch sporting events  many new york sports teams are really just new jersey teams but they do nt want to admit it   then there s the whole jersey shore thing  guidos and the loathing they engender in everyone they encounter is a phenomenon that existed long before mtv decided to cash in on it   in all honesty  new jersey really is nt that bad  it s kind of boring  you need a car to get anywhere  and most people are assholes  but that s true of many places across the country  if jersey was anywhere else in the country  geographically  it would nt get any of the hate it gets from new york  what the ny vs nj thing really boils down to is that people are used to the  feud  in much the same way that the whole america vs canada thing exists  though my instant reaction to hearing  canada  is  fuck canada   what i really mean is  fuck french canada   do i hate canadians  not really  but fuck canada  get it  just a long  running joke which gets easy laughs  i think the joke in  how i met your mother  is that ted is a bit of an elitist  and thinks that he is better than the jerseyans who visit new york  in  always sunny    well  they re actually in philadelphia  but the joke there is they re just mean  realistically  most new yorkers do nt put much thought into new jersey  and  in fact  most of the vendors probably like new jersey quite a bit  because they visit the city very often and spend lots of money  elycalifornian  they do nt really hate it  i think there s a similar pseudo  love  hate  just  because  theyre  there relationship between sf and oakland  if you do nt have enough money to live in sf  you live in oakland  right  except imagine if oakland was technically another state  and sf was about 10 times bigger  both in landmass and population  and everyone desperately wants to live there  and there s a hundred people who would love to take your place if you do nt make it there and end up moving back to the farm ,0

because the sensor  or film  is rectangular  so many answers  here are some   first off  there are cameras which take square pictures  but most do nt   movies are rectangular because they want to show multiple people side  by  side  since movies are an important source of pictures  it makes sense to have rectangular photos too   most analog cameras  your dad s camera  were 35 mm cameras  the film they used is the same film that was used for shooting most major movies  the film has a fixed width of 24 mm  film  as in movie  cameras expose the picture sideways onto the film strip  each frame is 24 mm wide and about 16 mm high  that resolution was not sufficient for good still images  moving images require less resolution   so still cameras expose pictures lengthwise onto the film strip  making each frame 24 mm high and 36 mm wide  so this was done to gain some more resolution while using film which already existed  using square images would have made the frames 24x24  which would have had less resolution   monitors and tvs are rectangular for various reasons  it makes sense to have a format which matches that   paper and thus tablets are rectangular  again  it makes sense to have a format which matches that  cropping  photographs looked like this a hundred years ago  url0,0
first let s mention the primary ingredients in lotions  ingredients to make a barrier between the skin and the outside world so water gets in  and ingredients that draw water into the skin  there are other ingredients  too  such as some products advertise that they have ingredients to make your skin appear younger  antioxidants  fragrance  etc  feet  people generally have very dry  thick skin on their feet  and do nt really worry about stuff like   will this make my feet look chalky    a lot of people also put this on their feet before bed or while they are at home instead of just going out  thus  foot creams are generally formulated to be thick and heavy  people generally do nt care if it contains sunscreen  hands  people want something fast absorbing so their hands are not sticky when they touch things  body  people have different priorities  some may want the thickest  most protective barreir they can find because they have very dry skin  or they may want a spray lotion that s super light so they can get dressed right away  face  generally people are heavily invested in products that claim to improve appearance  do nt worry  you can fap with it no matter what its for moisturizer is just a veneer of oil you put on your skin so that your natural oil does nt rub off faster than it s generated  or to quickly replace oil you have just removed somehow   theoretically you could use a stick of butter for the same effect  the three main ingredients in basically every moisturizer are   petroleum jelly  oily  waxy substance  the main workhorse  glycerol  hygroscopic liquid  ie it sucks in moisture from the air and your skin  making it feel wet   stearic acid  surfactant  softening agent  gets the first two ingredients to spread and stick onto your skin pretty much everything else is either substituting some of the petroleum jelly for a different type of oil that does exactly the same thing  fragrance  or naturopathic placebos like essence of gypsy wings ,0
burkina faso here  and most of the girls in my village have been circumcised  it is done to keep girls from being interested in sex when they come of age  it is also thought that this practice will make women more fertile and that those who are circumcised will have more children  it is technically illegal here  but it is very hard to enforce in local villages  and younger girls are starting to be informed that they can go to the police if anyone tries to circumcise them  but this is leading adults to start circumcising infants  i am optimistic  every girl i have talked to said that they will not circumcise their children  it will hopefully die out with the older generation passing  edit a lot of interesting discussion going on here  and a few people asking for an ama  tomorrow is our market day so the villagers i know will probably be busy  but keep your eyes peeled for an ama  i m sure the people i know would like to hear what americans  and the rest of the world  would have to ask about our village   we have been brought up according to certain morals  it shows good upbringing  a way of controlling a girl s sexual desire  sameya mohammad abdel  razek  a grandmother from the egyptian city of giza  talking about female genital mutilation  it s been illegal in egypt since 2008  but as many as  75  of the female population still undergo the procedure   url0   if i were explaining this to a five year old  i d do it as follows   some boys do nt like it when girls have as much fun as they do  they think that bullying them so only they have fun is better  i know that sounds crazy  but when your dad teaches you to do something  and your dad learned it from your grandad  and he learned it from his dad  and on and on back for a long time  it can be very hard to convince people to change their minds   one factor is that it can be uncomfortable to consider yourself as being victimized by your own parents  or culture  to make a deliberate decision to treat your children differently  you need to decide that you do nt like how you were treated  this can be very painful  enough that many people choose to continue the pattern instead  sometimes it s easier to say   that s just how things are done   rather than say   mom  what the fuck    and face the feelings that arise as a result of that ,0
i know some derivative markets work like this so maybe similar with futures  a futures contract commits two parties to a buysell of the underlying securities but with a futures contract you also create leverage because generally the margin you post on your futures contract is not sufficient to pay for the collateral in the underlying contract the person buying the future is essentially borrowing money while the person selling the future is essentially lending money the future you enter into is generally a short term contract so a perfectly hedged lender of funds should expect to receive something that approaches the fed funds rate in the us today that would be essentially nothing,0
when you select the remove usb safely option you are telling your computer to stop communicating with the usb device and to close any open files on the device this is important because it ensures that any data that is being transferred to or from the device is finished before you unplug it imagine that you are sending a letter through the mail you would not want to take the letter out of the envelope and stop writing in the middle of a sentence right it would be incomplete and hard to understandrnrnsimilarly when you unplug a usb device without properly removing it you might interrupt a process that was reading or writing data to the device this could cause the data to become corrupt or lost by properly removing the usb device you are allowing the computer to finish any ongoing processes and to close any open files on the device which helps to prevent data loss,1
in most countries marriage is considered to be a legal contract between two people this means that when two people get married they are making a commitment to each other to stay together and work on any problems that may arise in their relationship when one person wants to end the marriage it can be a difficult and emotional process for both people in order to make sure that both people are able to have their say and that the process is fair most countries have laws that require both people to agree to the divorceone reason for this is that divorce can have a big impact on both peoples lives especially if they have children or shared assets like a home or bank accounts its important that both people have a say in how these things are handled during the divorce processanother reason is that divorce can be a complicated process and its important that both people are able to come to an agreement on important issues like child custody alimony and the division of assets by requiring both people to agree to the divorce the law helps ensure that both people have a chance to have their needs and concerns heard and addressedi hope this helps to explain why both people in a marriage usually have to agree to a divorce if you have any other questions feel free to ask,1
water is required for life to exist on different planets because it is a chemical that is essential for many of the processes that sustain life water is a solvent which means that it can dissolve other substances and carry them throughout the body of an organism water is also a vital component of many biochemical reactions that are necessary for life such as the process of photosynthesis which allows plants to convert sunlight into energynnit is possible that some organisms might be able to survive in environments that are very different from the ones we are used to such as in sulfuric acid or in extreme heat however these sorts of environments are very rare and are not likely to be found on most planets most life forms need a certain range of temperatures pressures and other conditions to survive and water is usually a key component of these conditions,1

life insurance companies make money by selling life insurance policies to people and collecting premiums from those policyholders they also invest the money that they collect from premiums in a variety of financial products such as stocks bonds and real estate when the investments earn interest or dividends the insurance company can use that money to cover its operating expenses and make a profit heres an example of how it might work 1 a person buys a life insurance policy from an insurance company 2 the person pays a monthly or yearly premium to the insurance company 3 the insurance company takes the premium money and invests it in stocks bonds and other financial products 4 the investments earn interest or dividends over time 5 the insurance company uses the money from the investments to pay for its operating expenses such as employee salaries and office rent 6 if the money left over after paying expenses is more than the insurance company expected it can keep the extra money as profit i hope that helps let me know if you have any other questions,1
dairy cows are almost constantly pregnant or just after  birthed  meaning that they are constantly lactating  hence why dairy farms have such large stock and are able to constantly sell off cattle  a cow lactates approximately 340 days  cows generally can be bred back at 14 to 18 days after birth  gestation  or pregnancy  in cattle lasts 11 months  this means the cows do get a short break between lactation cycles and are nt actually continuously lactating  the first milk  colostrum  occurs the first days after birth to provide antibodies and extra nutrients for newborn  this milk is not used for human consumption  milk farm cows are continously artificially inseminated so they re always  just gave birth ,0
the prize money is interest paid in a form that is preferable to a number of low income folks  if the market interest on  100 would normally be  1  and lets use 10000 accounts as an example  then there s a pool of  10000 in interest and prizes  that could be distributed as 50   100 prizes  100   10 prizes  200   5 prizes  and 9560   030  prizes   the  070 in missing interest funds the prizes  since most people with the account were only going to earn  1 in interest  the loss is small for most but a few get a big prize  if the bank or system has more accounts  the prize size can grow  and rather than buying lottery tickets  even the losers get some interest  plus everyone gets their savings back to spend  reinvest   the purpose of the accounts is to shift excess resources of the poor from lottery tickets and raffles to savings  to understand where the prize money comes from you need to understand how a bank works  when you give a bank your money they do nt just keep it there for you  they lend it out to other people and charge them interest on their loan  in exchange for you letting them do this  the bank kicks you back some money in the form of the interest paid on your savings account  with prize linked savings accounts  a pool of savings accounts are all connected  each earning interest  because the bank is still lending that money out   and instead of you getting your typical monthly cut  the bank gives one guy  everyone s  cut from that month  so your prize is coming from the interest earned by other bank members  as well as interest you earned   this is a better explaination  lottery bonds are a type of government bond in which some randomly selected bonds within the issue are redeemed at a higher value than the face value of the bond  lottery bonds have been issued by public authorities belgium  france  ireland  pakistan  the uk and other nations  url0,0
depends on the software really  a 4ghz dual core and 6 core both run at the same frequency or clock cycle but may not have the same architecture which is actually more important for performance then raw clock speed  for your question though lets assume the architecture is the same and just the amount of cores is different  in hypothetical situation it depends really on how the software was designed  if it was designed to take advantage of 6 whole cores then it will likely perform much better on a 6 core processor than a dual but even today most programs are nt designed to use that many cores effectively  if a program at most only uses 2 of threads or cpu cores then you wo nt really see a benefit from having those extra cores  think of mhz as the speed limit on a highway  and cores as the number of lanes  as the mhz increases  processes in your computer can complete faster  as cores increase  it can do more things simultaneously  some computer workloads  single threaded  only care about mhz  they do nt ship things in multiple cars  so it does nt matter how big the highway is  only the speed limit  other workloads can use as many threads as its efficient to do so  most workloads fall somewhere in the middle  the advertised clock speed represents just one core  think of it like car engines  each piston can reach 8000 rpm  but a 12 cylinder engine will make a car go much faster than a 4 cylinder engine ,0

manual transmission vehicles also known as stick shift or manual shift vehicles are not dying off completely but they are becoming less popular there are a few reasons for this one reason is that automatic transmission vehicles are more convenient for most people automatic transmission vehicles are easier to drive because you dont have to worry about shifting gears yourself this is especially appealing for people who drive in heavy traffic or in areas with a lot of stop and go driving automatic transmission vehicles are also easier to use for people who are not experienced drivers another reason why manual transmission vehicles are becoming less popular is because they are less fuel efficient than automatic transmission vehicles automatic transmission vehicles are able to get better fuel economy because they can shift gears in a way that is more efficient for the engine this means that automatic transmission vehicles can save you money on gas over the long term finally manual transmission vehicles are becoming less popular because there are fewer and fewer cars being made with manual transmission many car manufacturers are focusing on making automatic transmission vehicles because that is what most people prefer as a result it can be harder to find a new car with a manual transmission overall manual transmission vehicles are still a good choice for some people but they are not as popular as they used to be,1

nasa which stands for the national aeronautics and space administration is based in florida for a few reasons one reason is because florida is close to the equator which makes it easier to launch rockets into space this is because the earths rotation is faster at the equator which means that rockets can get a little extra boost when they launch nanother reason is because florida has a long history with space travel the first american astronaut alan shepard launched into space from florida in 1961 since then many other important space missions have launched from florida including the apollo missions to the moon and the space shuttle program nfinally florida has a lot of open space and good weather which makes it a good place to test and launch rockets the kennedy space center which is located on the east coast of florida is the main launch site for nasa and has been used for many important space missions nso in short florida is a good place for nasa to launch rockets because its close to the equator has a long history with space travel and has a lot of open space and good weather,1
when you have a wound your bodys natural healing process starts to work to repair the damage as part of this process your body produces a protein called collagen which helps to rebuild and strengthen the skin when the wound is fully healed you may be left with a scar the appearance of a scar can depend on several factors including the size type and depth of the injury as well as your bodys natural healing processnnsome scars may be shiny because they contain more collagen while others may be darker because they contain more pigment cells the size and appearance of a scar can also be influenced by how well the wound was cared for while it was healingnnto help reduce the size or color of a scar you can try using overthecounter scar creams or gels that are specifically designed to help improve the appearance of scars you can also talk to your doctor or a dermatologist about other treatments that may be helpful such as corticosteroid injections or laser therapy remember to always follow your doctors instructions when using any type of scar treatment,1

the romani are a people that originally came from northern india and wandered into europe about 700 years ago  they ve maintained a nomadic lifestyle and culture that is distinct from the ones that surround them  the term  gypsy  is a misnomer that comes from a time when they were thought to come from egypt  their nomadic culture has put them at odds with a number of the agrarian and industrial cultures with which they come into contact  and made them pariahs in the agrarian society they originally found in europe  industrialization found them willing to take any job for any amount of pay  earning them the outrage of the developing working classes  who wanted more money for the same work  unions would work to exclude them for this reason  once again putting them at an economic disadvantage  read  making them poor   as we know about cultures that remain poor for a very long time  they resort to pretty much any means of survival  the law of the land became secondary to the law of a full stomach  thus  they became associated with crime and fraud in europe  some roma managed to make it to the united states  they ve found themselves better able to integrate here  as our society has some respected transient elements  particularly in the transportation industry  man of roma decent here  i work in a well paid job  live in a city flat  but move every 2 years  my family has traditions i do nt hear of outside of it  the indian decent is true and i do know that in mainland europe there is a problem with roma being linked to crime  but as has been said  when the population do nt want you to work there is very little else to turn to  most roma in scotland  where i am from  mixed with the scottish travelers  or tinkers  and live in houses now  except for my di  grandfather  who still lives in a caravan  big families are important and the tie between family is everything  job wise in scotland a lot of roma are members of the arts community  with some even holding decorations from the queen due to their services to it  other like myself are skilled tradesmen working as either self employed contractors or for contract companies  person from balkans here  which is the regions with most gypsies in europe  they call themselves many names  mostly romani and egyptians  but they actually come from india  because they find the term  gyspy  to be offensive  but we still call them that they are nomadic people  meaning that they have no permanent home  they move every now and then to a new country  they are very poor  and most often live off by begging on the streets or doing criminal activities  which involve  scavenging metals  pick pocketing  and selling stolen goods  they speak their own language  they do nt try to assimilate into the society  they do nt go to schools  have jobs or anything other  their means of transporations are horses  they are also the only brown  skinned people in this part of europe  no other visible minorities ,0

there are a few possible reasons why a bank might prefer a lower allcash offer over a higher offer that involves conventional lendingspeed an allcash offer is typically more likely to close quickly since it doesnt depend on the buyer being approved for a mortgage or the lender being satisfied with the propertys condition and value this can be especially appealing to a bank if the property has been on the market for a while and the bank is eager to sell itrisk a higher offer that involves conventional lending carries more risk for the bank since the bank is relying on the buyer being able to obtain financing and the property appraising at a high enough value to support the loan if either of these things doesnt happen the deal could fall through which would delay the sale and potentially result in the bank having to relist the property and go through the process againother considerations there may be other factors that make a lower allcash offer more appealing to the bank such as the buyer having a strong financial track record or being able to offer other nonfinancial incentives like agreeing to a longer closing period or taking on certain repairs or renovationsultimately the decision to accept a lower allcash offer over a higher offer that involves conventional lending will depend on the specific circumstances of the sale and the relative risks and benefits of each offer,1

great question oxygen is an essential element for human survival and it will be important for people living on mars to have a reliable source of oxygen there are a few different ways that people might be able to produce oxygen on mars 1 photosynthesis one way to produce oxygen on mars is through the process of photosynthesis which is how plants produce oxygen on earth scientists are working on developing special types of plants that can survive in the harsh conditions of mars and these plants could be used to produce oxygen for people to breathe 2 electrolysis another way to produce oxygen on mars is through a process called electrolysis this involves using electricity to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen on mars water can be found in the form of ice so it is possible to use electrolysis to produce oxygen from this water 3 moxie nasas mars perseverance rover which landed on mars in february 2021 includes a small device called the mars oxygen insitu resource utilization experiment moxie moxie is designed to produce oxygen from the carbon dioxide that is present in the martian atmosphere 4 bringing oxygen from earth finally it is also possible that people living on mars might have to bring some of their oxygen from earth this could be done by launching supplies to mars on a spacecraft or by producing oxygen on earth and then sending it to mars through some other means i hope this helps to explain how people might produce oxygen on mars let me know if you have any other questions,1

there are a few different factors that can contribute to a book becoming a bestseller one factor is the level of promotion and marketing that the book receives publishers and authors often work to get their books in front of as many people as possible by using various marketing strategies such as advertising in magazines and on television sending review copies to book reviewers and setting up book tours and speaking engagementsrnrnanother factor is the popularity of the subject matter or genre of the book for example a book about a popular celebrity or a book that fits into a popular genre such as mystery or romance may be more likely to become a bestsellerrnrnfinally the sales figures for a book can also play a role in its bestseller status different lists and organizations have different criteria for determining what counts as a bestseller but generally a book is considered a bestseller if it sells a large number of copies in a short period of time so if a lot of people are buying a particular book it may end up on a bestseller listrnrnits also worth noting that bestseller lists can be influenced by other factors such as the number of copies a publisher initially prints or the number of copies sold through a particular retailer as a result its possible for multiple books to be listed as bestsellers at the same time,1
christians associated goats with satan to spread their religion  here s a comment from another thread that details everything  u  girlgargoyle â€¢ jan 28  2015  213 pm when christianity was sweeping across europe  one major tactic it used in converting pagans was to get them to convert by adopting parts of their pagan heritage  then demonising the rest to ensure they never went back to their old ways  the greek god pan ended up being a major scapegoat  excuse the pun  and became thecommon depiction of satan in early medieval artwork  then we have the goat of mendes  it was a greek symbol based on an ancient egyptian god  named ba  no puns  linked to the soul and the afterlife  and for various reasons it stuck around as a common occult symbol  occultism is automatically considered satanic by many christians  in the 1800s  a man named eliphas levi cemented it  he drew on depictions of the goat of mendes to do a drawing called  baphomet   which was a fictional god some people invented to frame the knights templar for  devil worship  a few centuries earlier  his drawing of baphomet became infamous  and baphomet had always been linked with  or possibly a stand  in for  satan  that was really it for goats from then on  and any depiction of a goat  headed demon really draws on levi s depiction  in the 1960s  the church of satan adopted baphomet and the goat  head imagery as part of their official emblem  just as one final nail in the coffin for goats  url0 goats were associated with a number of pagan beliefs in europe  as christianity spread  they were cast in a sinister light and associated with evil and satanism  this entered the culture and persisted long after the pagans were gone  later  groups who wanted to link themselves to those pagan traditions  wiccans  or just wanted to be spooky in general  alistair crowley  anton levay  would invoke this wort of imagery to give a sense of authenticity  they kept this tradition alive enough for media to tap into it  using masks and headwear from animal heads is a practice in paganism  and this was used extensively by other religions throughout history to make people afraid of paganism  theater shows  and stories to scare kids throughout the last thousand years involve people with animal heads and other body parts from animals ,0

decision is nt quite the right word  after wwii the soviets held the northern part of korea  and the united states the south  they wanted korea to be remade suiting their own interests  which were in conflict  the soviet north made a soviet  styled north korea  the united states left a western  style democracy that would be amenable to us interests  the soviet union and china thought korea should be their friend  while the us thought korea should be their friend  so they had to compromise by splitting it  free elections were nt part of anyone s plan  though  after the split  south korea was just as much of a dictatorship as the north  korea was its own united entity  but then  during the late 1800s  it gradually came under the rule of imperial japan  the most powerful and technologically advanced nation in asia back then   then world war ii came  after axis forces  which included japan  were defeated  the two largest allied states  the us and the soviets  began to carve up the post  war world into their own spheres of influence  the soviet union wanted a pro  russian korea  and the us wanted a pro  american korea  they compromised by splitting it up  both north and south korea want the entire peninsula to be united again  but north korea wants the south to take on their laws and ideals  and vice versa  so a solution may have to wait for a few years  decades  edit  here s a  video   url0  ,0
get a bunch of particles moving really really fast  and make them slam into each other  see what happens  wackyvorlon did a good job of explaining how they work  the reason they are used is to run experiments that might show errors in our understanding of subatomic particles  if we really understand them  then we should be able to predict  or at least explain  what will happen when they collide at very  very high energies  what is the point of slamming them into each other at high energy  you can learn a lot about things if you take them apart and look at the pieces  with subatomic particles  however  you ca nt just use a knife  the sharpest knife that was ever made is still much  much  much too big  it s just not a job a knife can do  what is small enough  other particles just like it  of course  but if we push them into each other slowly  they ll just repel each other and slide off  if they touch at all   so we get huge numbers of them flying really fast in a circle  one huge bunch going clockwise  and another huge bunch going counterclockwise  and aim them at each other  even though the individual particles are really  really small  if we do this enough times  with enough bunches  a few particles will hit head  on and fly into pieces  then we can look at the pieces and see if they do what we expect  this is generally done with the  simpler  particles  one famous scientist described using this process with complicated particles   it s like slamming two swiss watches into each other and trying to figure out how they work by watching the pieces fly off   take a magnet  then a second magnet  if they have the same poles facing each other  you can push the first magnet along a table  now take the magnet and make it really tiny  like a single proton  you can still push it using a magnetic field  this poses a problem in air  though  it s like trying to push the magnet through a tub full of basket balls  we need to remove the basket balls  that s why the inside of a particle accelerator is a vacuum  it s hard to pick out just a single proton  plus the goal is to whack them together to see what they shatter into  so we make a whole stream of them  then we fire two streams at each other  and millions of protons hit each other and shatter  the debris from this tells us what the proton was made of ,0
it compresses the small capillaries and vessels near the surface  forcing  diverting more blood through muscles and organs where it is needed  you do nt circulate more overall  but you are circulating more where it s needed  blood is pumped throughout your body to help with basically every function  it keeps your muscles and other systems working at their best by delivering oxygen and nutrients and removing waste buildup  compression clothing it helps the most with blood returning from your limbs  especially your feet and legs  blood has a much easier time going down to your feet because your heart is pumping it through a high pressure system  think of your arteries as being like a garden hose  and it has gravity helping it downwards  blood returning to the heart has a much more difficult time because it is moving upwards against gravity  and also because your veins  containing blood  and lymph vessels  containing other fluids and wastes  are nt pressurized like a hose  they act more like a plastic bag being filled up with a liquid  they expand as they fill but are nt under high pressure   they are usually helped by your muscles  which compress them and force blood  fluid back towards your torso  when your muscles are weak  tired  or if there are other issues with these veins and vessels there is even less pressure to help this upward flow  compression helps pressurize them  especially near the skin s surface  and helps blood flow back to your heart  which reduces swelling  edema  and removes waste near the extremities  if graduated compression is used  ie socks that have maximum compression at the ankle and less compression up along the leg  it s even more effective because it creates a pressure gradient  which further encourages movement of blood and fluid away from the foot  there are other compression uses to help things like si joint issues by providing stability  but the most use i see is to help with circulation  hopefully that was nt too long  detailed for an eli5  and hopefully it answers your question  source  work in sports medicine related field where we sell medical grade compression products like socks  tights for poor circulation  diabetic issues  i bought white compression shirts to use as undershirts  they work to hide manboobs  also  as a side effect improve posture  it shows you what would look like if you lost 3 pounds  and maybe coincidentally i have lost a lot of weight  tldr they solve all problems,0
you could have both options exercised and assigned to you on the same day but i dont think you could lose money on both on the same day the reason is that while exercises are immediate assignments are processed after the markets close at the end of each day see httpwww888optionscomhelpfaqassignmentjsp for details so you would get both assignments at the same time that night the net effect should be that you dont own any stock someone would put you the stock then itd be called away and you dont have the options anymore you should have incoming cash of 1500 selling the stock to the call exerciser and outgoing cash of 1300 buying from the put exerciser right so you would have no more options but 200 more cash in your account in the morning you bought at 13 and sold at 15 this options position is an agreement to buy at 13 and sell at 15 at someone elses option the way you lose money is if one of the options isnt exercised while the other is ie if the stock is below 13 so nobody is going to opt to buy from you at 15 but theyll sell to you at 13 or above 15 so nobody is going to opt to sell to you at 13 but theyll buy from you at 15 you make money if neither is exercised you keep the premium you sold for or both are exercised you keep the gap between the two plus the premium having both exercised is surely rare since early exercise is rare to begin with and tends to happen when options are deep in the money so youd expect both to be exercised if both are deep in the money at some point having both be exercised on the same day  cant be common but its maybe most likely just before expiration with minimal time value if the stock moves around quickly so both options are in the money at some point during the day,0
almost 80 years ago some local farmers began having problems with the local emu population  the emus believed themselves to be king tut and strutted around the area  they had a large population and needed the land more than a few measly farmers  the farmers recognized they were greatly outnumbered and called in assistance from the australian government  they sent in military aid in the form of a handful of soldiers and automatic weapons  the gods showed kindness to the emus and sent rain  slowing the soldiers down for a bit  on november 2nd the great emu war began  soldiers set up a firing line  but because the emus are so cunning they recognized this and stayed outside of the effective firing range of the enemy soldiers weapons  local farmers were sent out to try and lure the emus into the ambush  but the emus knew the trap and broke down into small herds  teams to make themselves more difficult to target  unfortunately nearly a dozens emus lost their lives that day  on november 4th the australian soldiers were able to successfully set up a ambush near the local dam  a place where emus went to refresh themselves with drink and bathe  the gods once again smiled upon the emus  no more than 12 fell that day before the coward australian soldier guns jammed  stopping their assault and giving the emus time to escape  various mistakes on the soldiers part gave great help to the emus being able to outlast their opponents  on november 8th the emus were able to successfully push back the australians after a battle of attrition  the australians wasted numerous resources on this engagement for little results  because of their victory the emus were embolden  and began attacking crops  they were looking to make the local farmers pay for their collaboration with the australian soldiers  they came in the thousands  tearing up the country side  once again in fear the farmers begged the government for assistance  after a 4 days rest on november 12th the australian government began military action once again  this time the emus did not fair well  by december 2nd they were faced with a thousand dead and thousands more wounded and presumed dead  since the end of the great emu war the emus never once forgot the death and destruction that was inflicted upon them  every few years the farmers go back to their government requesting assistance  the emus are waging guerrilla warfare  coming out and attacking then retreating back  some say the emus are still out there today  planning  plotting  one day they will retake their lands and expel those who deny them  ew ii is coming  a group of emus were being dicks  army told em to fuck off  emus were like cash me ousside how bow dah  army tried to cash the emus ousside  decisive emu victory  it was basically a wildlife cull  there was an infestation of emus into farming land  which damaged the crops and reduced the yield  so there were attempts to reduce the population  many of the farmers involved were re  settled ww1 soldiers  and they convinced the ministry of defence that machine guns would be the most effective way to cull  cue a detachment of soldiers turning up with their machine guns  expecting to just start blasting away  emus can run fast  and it s not easy to hit a small target that s rapidly moving away from you  so the planned  cull  was rather underwhelming and unsuccessful  since most of the birds simply ran away  the concept of the military being outrun and outwitted by a bunch of flightless birds was so comical  the  emu war  became a running media joke at the time  and has stuck since ,0

it s a myth  you absolutely can put hot food directly into the fridge  if it is a large amount of food you want to break it down into smaller portions and the refrigerate  there is a window of time when it is considered safe to eat food that is not at temperature to inhibit bacterial growth  the temperature will depend on the food in question on the hot endarond 140 degrees  and 40 degrees on the low end  if you put a large bulk of hot food in a regular home refrigerator it will take too long to cool it down to a the low temperature you need to keep it from becoming a bacterial orgy  the heat from your hot food will warm up the rest of the fridge  this happens any time you add food the fridge  but we like to minimize it whenever possible for a few reasons  1  refrigerators remove heat to cool food to whatever temperature they re set  so if you add something with a lot of heat  it has to work a lot harder to cool back down  2  depending on the temperature and the amount of hot food  the increased temperature inside the fridge can warm up the other food for a bit  so if you let food cool down on the counter before you put it in the fridge  you re not making it work as hard  good for the longevity of an expensive appliance   and you re helping keep the rest of your food cold  which also helps it s shelf life  it s also not a huge deal unless you re putting things in the fridge almost immediately after they come out of like  the oven  at that point  the extreme temperature differences could cause cracking if you re using glass containers  shelves  and plastic in the fridge that s in direct contact could be damaged too  condensation is a big reason to at least hold off on covering the dish  if not letting it cool on the counter first  some foods that have a more sensitive maturing  sequence  of its flavors or textures wo nt set properly if they cool too fast  the most important thing here is that food be brought to safe storage temp within two hours  you do nt want susceptible foods  especially meats  growing nasty bacterial blooms  putting food in large volumes into the fridge may keep the middles from not cooling in time  so for large volumes be sure to break your serving down into family size tupperwares or smaller  do nt just drop the whole 5  gallon pot of chili in the fridge ,0

people with autism spectrum disorder asd experience the world differently than people who do not have asd they may have difficulty understanding and expressing their own emotions and the emotions of others they may also have trouble communicating with others and may engage in repetitive behaviors its important to remember that each person with asd is unique and will have their own thoughts feelings and experiences its not possible for me to know exactly what goes through the mind of an autistic person but i can try to explain it in a way that might be easier to understand imagine that you are standing on a busy street and there are lots of cars driving by honking their horns and making lots of noise now imagine that instead of just one street you are standing in the middle of a city with lots of streets and lots of cars it might be overwhelming and difficult to focus on just one thing thats kind of how it might feel for someone with asd when they are in a busy place with a lot of people talking and making noise it might be hard for them to focus on just one thing and they might feel overwhelmed its also important to remember that people with asd are just like anyone else they have their own interests passions and feelings they may just have a harder time expressing them or understanding the emotions of others,1

a while back thq invested heavily in a peripheral device called the udraw tablet  they threw money at it to develop it for some casual games  and it flopped  hard  they where unable to recoup the lost money and have been on a slope downward every since  while not appropriate for eli5  here is one of the  bankruptcy documents   url0  where the ceo explains what when wrong in paragraphs 30  39  here is my quick take on a summary  1  they used to make games for kids or based on movies  you do nt get paid a lot to do that  but the amount of effort to make such a game is pretty predictable  but then that market dried up  2  so then they tried to make  hit  games  which is riskier  your guys have to spend much more time  which costs money  developing a game  and the sales are less certain  for the last five years they were unprofitable  3  along they way they tried to make udraw  this was tricky because they had to guess how many they were going to sell  they ordered a lot thinking they could sell the udraw for a high price  they were wrong on price and amount  and had to sell at a loss to get rid of the ones they ordered  4  then they paid    to get some big shots and fired half the company  hoping to be profitable  5  along the way  their credit card balance was getting too high and the banks put them on a special budget  when this happened their partners in europe were afraid to share money because it might not come back  so they had even less money  6  when making a video game you pay your developers to make the game upfront  but you do nt get to sell it until the game is finished and ready to play  the next release  pay day for the company  was march 2013  but in january the special budget was up  the banks were scared and the  friends  in europe were scared too  everyone decided it would be better to sell the different divisions to try to pay back the banks  i have a related question  bids were apparently due yesterday  and i m wondering who put theirs in  is that information public ,0
the color of your eyes is determined by the amount and type of pigments in your iris which is the colored part of your eye and by the way that the iris scatters light the iris contains two types of pigment one called melanin which gives your skin hair and eyes their color and another called lipochrome which is a yellowish pigment the combination of these pigments along with the structure of the iris determines the color of your eyes nthere are many different shades of eye color ranging from dark brown to light blue and the most common eye colors are brown blue and green the color of your eyes is determined by your genes which are the instructions that you inherit from your parents that tell your body how to grow and function nthere is no scientific evidence to suggest that the color of your eyes has any special meaning or significance however many people believe that the color of your eyes can reveal certain things about your personality or your health but these beliefs are not supported by scientific evidence nin short the color of your eyes is simply a result of the combination of pigments and the way that light is scattered by your iris and it has no special meaning or significance,1
yes  but primitive life would nt find us  the only way we would find primitive life is if we advanced enough to search for them  edit  it should be noted that loads of sci  fi presents ets that are less advanced than we are  it s all to do with who finds who  any extraterrestrial life that finds us must necessarily have found a way to use interstellar travel and so must  by necessity  be more advanced than we are  if  in the science fiction  we are the ones who discover life then yes  they could easily be on the same level or more primitive but sci  fi as a genre is full of stories about of exactly that  indeed  star trek s  prime directive  was invented specifically to address this issue  that s not even the case  simple rule  if they find us  they are more advanced  if we find them  we are  take for example avatar  they fight with bow and arrow against modern weapons ,0
payday loan companies basically are banks although they are incredibly terrible ones banks make money in two ways  1 they charge fees for services they provide bank account fees etc and 2 the interest rate differential they borrow money from individuals and corporations your savings account is essentially money you are loaning to the bank for a small  paid to individuals and then lend that money back to other people for a higher  ie you might earn 05 on your savings account but then the bank takes that money and lends it to your neighbor for 25 as part of their mortgage payday loan companies make money in one way they charge an enormous markup on money lent out to other people the rates in some cases are so high annualized interest rates of 1000 are not uncommon in countries without full regulation of this industry that it barely matters where they get money from they might get money from investors who bought shares in the company giving the company initial cash in the hope that they give dividends down the road they might get money from other real banks who lend money just like they would lend money to any other business with a regular interest rate or they might have many from many other sources they might even issue their debt publically so that individuals could buy bonds from the company and receive a small amount of interest every year the point is that the rates of return on the money leant by payday loan companies are so high that the cost of where the money comes from is not terribly relevant,0
closing the eyes of a deceased person is a common practice that is often performed as a gesture of respect for the deceased it is also done to create a more peaceful appearance for the person who has died when a person is alive the eyes are open when they are awake and closed when they are asleep closing the eyes of a deceased person can make them look like they are at rest which can be comforting to the family and friends of the deceased nthere are also practical reasons for closing the eyes of a deceased person for example if the eyes are left open they may dry out and become difficult to close later in addition open eyes can be disturbing for people who are present when the body is discovered as it can make the person look like they are staring or looking at something noverall closing the eyes of a deceased person is a way to show respect and provide comfort to the family and friends of the deceased and to create a more peaceful appearance for the person who has passed away,1

income from a hobby is tax exempt under dutch law to consider whether its hobby a few rules are applied such as how much time do you spend on the activity and is the hourly wage low obviously having a boss is a sure sign of it not being a hobby the typical example is making dolls and selling them on a crafts fair if you travel the country and sell each weekend on a different fair thats a lot of time if you only sell them on the fair in your home town its a hobby  situation 3 is the most difficult if you just happened to luck out its still a hobby if you spent significant time to improve the value of your holdings eg by trading ingame then it might be seen as work in the latter case you simply file it as income from other sources not yet taxed  for the purpose of determining income from a hobby you may deduct actual expenses so in your case theyd look at the net income of 1000 which is not unusual for a hobby it wouldnt be any different if you took up horse riding decided that you didnt like it and sell your horse at a loss,0

pictures make this work much better  what you re seeing is a moire pattern  you probably noticed that this happens when the camera is very sharply in focus  and mysteriously goes away when the image gets very slightly blurred  the reason is your camera s sensor does nt capture a grid of tightly packed squares  it captures a grid of tiny dots that actually have a fair amount of space between them  your tv s display surface is similar  there are tiny sources of light surrounded by dark lines where either there are nt any phosphors  or where there are edges of opaque material between the lcds  when the image of the tv screen is in perfect focus on your image sensor  sometimes the lines go between the tiny sensor dots  and that pixel gets the full bright color it should  but sometimes the lines go right over the sensor dots  so that dot picks up the dark line or the area between phosphors  and that whole pixel gets a darker color even though only a tiny part of that region was dark  try it  find a way to deliberately defocus the camera a little bit  and the dots will go away  also  as you move the camera you ll see the pattern shifts and changes as you move  that s a telltale sign of moire patterns  because your eyes are too slow to  catch  it updating  everyones are  the pixels do nt all change at once  b  c the computer controlling them can only do a couple of things at a time  it updates them one or two at a time  in rows  usually top to bottom  and left to right  sometimes in different patterns to ease the transition  but you re camera is catching it in  between updating frames  your eyes take in a nearly constant stream of information  cameras  however  only open their shutter for a tiny fraction of a second  tv screens flash images  or more often parts of images  many times per second  your eyes take in these flashes of images and perceive a constant stream of video  your camera captures only the part that flashes while it s shutter is open  making it look strange ,0
so a group of people showed up on a piece of land  they were explorers  and wanted some land for themselves because the place they come from was too crowded  they started to build a society  little hut homes for everyone  and some people decided to farm  some people decided to make clothes  some people decided to fish  and so on  everyone agrees that hey  we need some roads and schools  so the guys who makes the roads and schools agree to do it for some fish  and crops and clothes and what not  time goes on and eventually they switch to a money system  and the road and school builder is like  hey  i m not doing this for free   and the people are getting greedy and keeping all their money to themselves  instead of helping out the guy build the road  the leader is like  ok  what s the deal guys   and makes it a law that you got ta help the guy build roads and schools and what not  cause people wo nt do it for the  common good   income taxes are a government mandated way of helping pay for stuff everyone uses  but no one wants to foot the full cost of  such as roads  schools  armies  healthcare  and that sort of thing  it s a way of evening out the large costs of infrastructure    constitutional basis   article i  section 8  clause 1 of the united states constitution assigns congress the power to impose  taxes  duties  imposts and excises     when   the 16th amendment was ratified in 1913 and this was the start of the income tax in the us   why   the government was getting larger and larger as time went on and a universal tax seemed to make more sense than the previous system that was reliant on tariffs on imported goods  some governments make their own money from government businesses  or instance oil   some governments do not make enough  or any or lose money doing this  so they have to get money from the people  they could get it from your property  what you already own  or from your money  one way to get your money is right when you earn it  this is basically the income tax  it is a method the government gets money so it can run ,0

sure a sailboat is able to sail into the wind because of the shape and angle of its sails the wind pushes against the sails and the sails push against the wind causing the boat to move forwardrnrnimagine you are standing in a field holding a big piece of cloth if you hold the cloth out in front of you and the wind blows against it the cloth will billow and fill with air now if you tilt the cloth at a slight angle the wind will still be able to blow against it but it will also push the cloth and you forwardrnrnthis is similar to how a sailboats sails work the sail is held out at an angle and the wind blows against it causing the boat to move forward the sailor can adjust the angle of the sail to make the boat go faster or slower or to turn in different directionsrnrni hope that helps do you have any other questions about sailboats or how they work,1

there are two main ways to do it one way is literally just a strong suction cup  you stick it in the middle  pull really hard  and  pop  no more dent the other way is to hammer the dent out  this can be done with the body panel on or off the car and it depends on the panel  the mechanic will literally hammer the panel from the backside until it is back into roughly its original shape remove and replace with new  the entire front end is all separate pieces and can be replaced independently of the others depending on what is damaged  same with the trunk and rear bumper  the rest quarter of the car is harder since the metal is nt removable  it needs to be cut and then welded in  once the new parts are in the car is then repainted to match the original color  metal can bend  shrink and expand  most automotive body panels are stretched by the process of pressing  this makes sheet metal firmer but not stronger  it s reasonably easy to dent a firm panel but it s also relatively easy to return it to its former shape as long as the dent is reversed  meaning to undo the  hit  simply expand the shrunken metal from the same trajectory as the impact then most times it  pops  back to its stretched state  using some heat will also help shrink it back to place  people who smash car panels with a hammer need to use a body filler to get rid of all the whacking scars  so when a dude says it s full of bondo or bog  it s a sign that the repair was not as good as it could have been,0
the fifth amendment to the united states constitution provides that no person â€¦ shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself this means that in a criminal case a person has the right to remain silent and not answer questions that might incriminate themselves however it is important to note that this right is not absolute a judge may decide to deny a person the right to remain silent in certain circumstances for example if a person is on trial and refuses to testify the judge may hold them in contempt of court which means that they are not following the courts rules this can result in the person being sentenced to jail or paying a fine it is also important to note that the fifth amendment applies only in criminal cases it does not apply in civil cases or in situations where a person is not a suspect or a defendant i hope this helps to clarify the situation if you have any additional questions please dont hesitate to ask,1
chromosomes are funny blob  shaped things that are too small for us to see and they contain all your genes  genes are basically sets of instructions that tell your body how to grow and work properly  every normal person has 23 pairs of chromosomes  each pair should normally be a matching copy  excepting x and y chromosomes  i ll explain this later   when a mommy and daddy have had sex and create a baby inside the mommy s womb  sometimes a mistake happens  it is nobody s fault  but the new baby has   3   copies of chromosome number 21 instead of just 2 copies like a normal person would  this means the new baby s body gets the wrong instructions on how to grow  and so it grows into a funny shape  the genes that tell a person s face what shape it will be are messed up and that s why most people with down syndrome have strange looking faces  the extra chromosome also makes the down syndrome person s brain grow funny  which is why down syndrome people are usually not as smart as other people  now you might be wondering why boys and girls are different if everyone has the same 23 pairs of chromosomes  the answer is that everyone  does nt   girls have two  x  chromosomes  they are called that because they look like the letter x   but boys are different  instead of having two x chromosomes  they have an x and a   y   chromosome  it is this y chromosome that contains all the instructions to tell their body how to become a boy s body  there are many other problems that can happen if something is wrong with a person s chromosomes  down syndrome is only one  edit  so the reason that down syndrome people s faces all have those similar features is because they all have the same problem with their genes  an extra copy of chromosome 21  the real question is  why do so many of the people who wonder this fail to use the search function  url6 url3 url2 url4 url1 url5 url7 url8 url0 url9 people with downs syndrome also have similarly shaped fingerprint patterns  if you knew what to look for  you could spot someone with downs just by seeing their dusty prints ,0
empirial evidence for the second scenario can banks individually create money out of nothing â€” the theories and the empirical evidence excerpt it was examined whether in the process of making money available to   the borrower the bank transfers these funds from other accounts   within or outside the bank in the process of making loaned money   available in the borrowers bank account it was found that the bank   did not transfer the money away from other internal or external   accounts resulting in a rejection of both the fractional reserve   theory and the financial intermediation theory instead it was found   that the bank newly â€˜inventedâ€™ the funds by crediting the borrowers   account with a deposit although no such deposit had taken place this   is in line with the claims of the credit creation theory thus it can now be said with confidence for the first time â€“ possibly   in the 5000 years history of banking  that it has been empirically   demonstrated that each individual bank creates credit and money out of   nothing when it extends what is called a â€˜bank loanâ€™ the bank does   not loan any existing money but instead creates new money the money   supply is created as â€˜fairy dustâ€™ produced by the banks out of thin   air,0

it would seem that you are in a position where you are able to save money and you hope to have your money work for you from your statement above it is implied that you are a professional with a steady income not related to the finance field with that said it is better to diversify your portfolio and have your money work for you through passive investments rather than an active one where you actively search for companies that are below market price that research takes time and much more experience in order to properly execute  now if your overall goal is to trade actively then maybe researching individual companies might be the best way to get your feet wet but if your goal is to create a diversified portfolio and make your money work for you then passive is the way to go  two passive financial vehicles  mutual funds and etfs depending on what you are hoping to accomplish in the future an etf or a mutual fund will likely suite your situation i would encourage you to do your due diligence and find out the weakness and strength of each from there you are able to make an informed decision,0
habitat does nt simply build new homes  they also renovate existing properties  the recipients of the property  whether new or renovated  are participants in the build  i volunteered for habitat all throughout high school and college  i must have worked on 5 or 6 sites  but only 2 were new construction  that i can remember   habitat for humanity does nt just buy building materials with cash that could be used elsewhere  for example  to buy an already  built house   they receive donations in the form of building supplies  drywall  lumber  insulation  paint etc  yes  cash donations as well im sure  but a lot of physical donations  additionally  the process for getting a house through habitat is complex  it requires the future homeowner to put in a certain number of hours of physical labor  not just on their own home but on other homes as well  it is nt as simple as handing someone keys to their new home  in short  habitat focuses not just on giving people homes  but in requiring that they put in time and effort to gaining those homes  source  served some hours at habitat during my union apprenticeship  habitat s goal is for everyone to have access to a simple  decent place to live  the homes that have been foreclosed on are typically more expensive than the average habitat house  in the us  at least   that average cost in the us is  46600source   url0  as mentioned in other answers  the banks are in the business of profit  the overwhelming majority of new homes that were bought in the housing boom cost the bank far more than  46k  that average was  301900 in december 2006source   url1   the costs associated with houses of the average type sold  versus what habitat s mission is to provide  is such that those houses are nt affordable  remember that even if those houses cost only  100k to build  say  the bank still wants to get  300k for the house   46k is not at all appealing to them  banks are nt charities  quite simply  there s actually a good deal of disagreement within habitat about how much effort and money is put toward the us housing goals compared to their worldwide mission  because the cost of a house here is so much greater than the cost of a house elsewhere in the world  for example  i worked on a habitat house in mexico that was going to cost something like  4000  for a very adequate block house with running water and gas for cooking  the family was upgrading from a sheet  metal shack built against the fence bordering their property  edit  as others have noted  habitat also does renovations  which are a big part of their evolving mission  they re adding disaster relief  as well  katrina  haiti  and the tsunami really lead the organization to develop a new focus on disaster response  because a slate wiped clean as a result of a disaster is a place of very very high need  and has the opportunity for habitat to start from the ground up in rebuilding whole neighborhoods  which is a good way to get around the occasional opposition the international organizations run into from existing homeowners when they want to do larger projects  when noone s got a house  as grim as it sounds  it s easier to do more space and energy and cost  efficient projects for everyone  source on all this  links above  and 15 years as a habitat volunteer  i have traveled to 3 continents for habitat work  spent 4 months interning at their european hq  and my mom has been executive director of 2 affiliates in the us ,0

google fiber is a highspeed internet service that google offers in some parts of the united states while it is not free it is designed to provide very fast and reliable internet access to customersnnone way that google can afford to offer this service is by charging a onetime fee to cover the cost of installing and setting up the service this fee helps to pay for things like the fiber optic cables that are used to deliver the internet signal to homes and businesses as well as the equipment and labor needed to set up the servicennanother way that google makes money from fiber is by charging a monthly fee for the service this fee helps to cover the ongoing costs of maintaining and improving the service such as upgrading equipment and paying for additional bandwidthnnoverall google fiber is a paid service but it is designed to offer highquality internet access at an affordable price by charging fees for the service google is able to cover the costs of providing it and continue to offer it to customers,1
because if they do nt pay  the throttling continues  by paying netflix can remove the throttling and make more money by delivering its product to its customers  sure it costs netflix money  but they can make more money if comcast is nt throttling them  i think  this   url0  comment was the best so far that i have seen  link here   url0  netflix is a content delivery company  their streaming business depends on getting you high quality content through the internet  if netflix provided poor picture quality  you would look to other providers or other technologies  back to bluray   what s unique about netflix is that they deliver so much content that it is highly visible to the isps  like 30  of download traffic every night   isps own the means of distribution  for every home there is one maybe two viable bandwidth options  they have a great deal of power because the networks are all private  and to a large extent they can see and control what goes through their network  it is in netflix s best interest to pay the isps for two reasons  1  it ensures that their product quality is high and 2  it creates a barrier of entry to other companies  competitors will now have to spend in a similar fashion to have a similar product  which reduces the amount of competition ,0
dehydrated meat loses a lot of size  a relatively small amount of jerky takes a lot of meat to make   here is a website that answers your exact question    url0  tldr it s expensive to make  according to the website  10 lbs of fresh beef  3  4 lbs of jerky  i can help here  food scientist and i do a lot of private consulting for beef jerky companies  first and foremost its important to know how beef jerky is made  beef jerky starts off as large cuts of meat  this meat is then marinated for roughly 24 hours  some longer and some shorter   the next step is processing  ie smoke houses   the meat is taken from the marinates which usually consists of water  sugar  spices  flavors and an antimicrobial  the smoke houses are very expensive machines and they are basically dehydrating the meat and adding  smoke  flavor and color  as the meat dehydrates  losing water  from its natural size  a lot of weight is lost  this makes the 1  steak much smaller  because the company pays for the meat on its initial weight before losing all that water  the are basically shrinking their weight  thus having to charge more to even out their costs and processing  packaging is also very expensive as are the machines that do map  modified atmosphere packaging  that sucks the normal air  nitrogen  oxygen  carbon dioxide etc   and replaces it with a low oxygen air in order to keep rancidity from oxidation down  this means better flavor  some beef jerky can last nearly a year in the packaging you would buy from jack links or orberto  before opening    edit  spelling,0

yes to all of the previous posts  your system is like a katamari ball rolling around picking up junk  slowing it down  additionally  new software is generally written for newer hardware  it takes more cpu cycles  memory  and storage space to install and run  in this case  your computer is nt really getting slower  but rather the world around it is outgrowing your hardware  video game consoles are not usually subject to this because the hardware they have is the hardware they have  that is to say  software and game creators design their games to run specifically with the console hardware requirements in mind  although game engines get better  they are built to accommodate the console hardware since upgrading is not an option  the more time you spend on your computer  the more crap it picks up  these crap files  programs slowly clog up the computer and slow it down  consoles do nt have this problem as you do nt download nearly as much crap onto it  also these days companies like to program things to break after a certain amount of time  computers only get slower if you keep filling them up with junk that run in the background  if you re install a fresh copy of windows  or your os of choice  they should get back to the speed they had new ,0

great question the reason planets dont travel around the sun in a perfect circle is because they are affected by the suns gravity which pulls them towards the sun however planets also have their own momentum or movement which causes them to keep moving in a straight line unless something else changes their direction the combination of the suns gravity and the planets momentum causes the planet to follow an elliptical or ovalshaped orbit around the sun this means that the planet is sometimes closer to the sun and sometimes farther away just like you described i hope that helps do you have any other questions about planets or the solar system,1
99 cent stores work by buying products in bulk at a low price and then selling them in their stores for a low price the products that they sell can be a variety of things including food household items toys and more they are able to offer low prices because they buy the products at a lower cost than other stores and they also often have a smaller selection of products to choose from some 99 cent stores may buy products that are close to their expiration date but this is not always the case they may also buy products that have been overstocked by other stores or that have been discontinued by the manufacturer the goal of a 99 cent store is to offer low prices on a wide variety of products so that people can save money when they shop,1
crayons are good for kids because they are bright  safe to eat  hard to poke your eye out with  and pretty cheap  colored pencils offer better control and a neater end product  but cost more  and are more dangerous  i think at some point artists move on to pastels  colored pencils  or markers because they can be more easily controlled to achieve a variety of desired effects  crayons give you a very distinct  rough texture and you do nt have much of an option for changing that by smudging or keeping a sharp point  for design use  crayon texture is easily identifyable and has come to represent childhood  so it is usually only used when that s what you are trying to express  then again  maybe we should give crayons another chance  url0  are colored pencils superior  and if so  why ca nt children use them too  they are  for drawing  they are also superior for poking your eye out  crayons are safe  non  toxic  and low maintenance  and considering the drawing ability of most children  colored pencils are not going to add much ,0

there is no center  all distant objects we can see are receding from us  more distant objects are receding more quickly  the same is true wherever you are  if you pick a point  it appears every  distant  object is moving away from that point  this is because space is expanding everywhere  similarly  if you take a ruler and pretend you are at 4 1  2  3  4  5  6  7 and start stretching it  it looks like everything is moving away from you  2  3  4  5  6   so you might think  oh  4 is the center of the universe  but what does the guy at 7 see  this  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 becoming  5  6  7  8  9   there is no central location  it s not as though objects are moving  outwards  from an explosion  distances themselves are growing with time  where is the centre of the universe  there is no centre of the universe  according to the standard theories of cosmology  the universe started with a  big bang  about 14 thousand million years ago and has been expanding ever since  yet there is no centre to the expansion  it is the same everywhere  the big bang should not be visualised as an ordinary explosion  the universe is not expanding out from a centre into space  rather  the whole universe is expanding and it is doing so equally at all places  as far as we can tell  url0 if you trace back the movement of all of the galaxies  you â€™ll find that they were all once right on top of you  you are the center of the observable universe  because you are the observer  everything was once where you are  but has since expanded away ,0
you ve got the gist  for the long version  here s a response i typed to a similar question earlier   in the us  common  law murder is the intentional taking of a human life with  malice aforethought   in this context   malice aforethought  is a term of art  meaning the defendant did not only intend his actions  but intended that his actions kill the other person  the difference will become more clear in the examples below   that said  crimes in most states are statutory now  and murder is often split into a number of  degrees   usually 2 or 3   nonetheless  all statutory murders fall within this definition   before jumping into the different degrees  it s important to note that the  malice aforethought  element can manifest at any time prior to the killing  if i get in a heated argument with someone and decide on the spot to put a letter opener through their eye  i have every bit as much  malice aforethought  as someone who has been slowly poisoning their spouse for months  both are murder   first degree murder  otherwise known as  premeditated murder   first degree murder requires that the defendant form some plan to effect the killing of the victim in advance  there are different legal tests for deciding whether there was premeditation  but as a general rule of thumb  if the defendant takes some act to prepare himself for the crime  sharpening a knife  cleaning and loading a gun  in advance of encountering the victim  that s usually enough to at least infer premeditation   example  d  defendant  shoots v  victim  in a bar fight  but the prosecution discovers that d purchased his handgun only days before the fight  and discovers a page in d s journal indicating that v would be at that specific bar at the specific time d ultimately murdered him  it s not an air tight case for murder one  but it s enough to infer premeditation   second degree murder  this is the same as first degree  just without the premeditation  in other words  the defendant develops his  malice aforethought  shortly before the killing  as opposed to deliberating over it and preparing himself in advance of meeting the victim   example  d and v get in a bar fight  v knocks d to the ground and walks away  a moment later  d jams a broken bottle into v s neck  killing him  here  d clearly intended to kill v  which makes it murder   but there s nothing really indicating that he planned the situation   third degree  third degree murder does nt exist in every jurisdiction  and there s not a one  size fits all definition  sometimes  it s just another label for  voluntary manslaughter   explained below   other times  it s regular second degree murder with a number of mitigating factors  often times  it s another label for  felony murder   which is the unintentional killing of a person committed in the course of a violent felony  eg  i drop my gun during a bank robbery and it goes off  accidentally killing the teller   as is the case in florida  if you re interested in the zimmerman case    manslaughter is a substantially different animal from murder  in generally comes in the voluntary and involuntary flavors   voluntary manslaughter  this is either  a  a murder with substantial mitigating factors  or  b  a death that results when i intend to inflict serious bodily harm on another  in the first case   malice aforethought  is still present  but there are factors making the killer less culpable  such as a serious provocation   example  d catches v in bed with his wife  an brains him with the lamp by the table  killing him  d intended to kill v  but he was provoked by v s banging of his wife  note that the reasonableness of the provocation is often an issue here  and some jurisdictions are trending away from mitigating murder to voluntary manslaughter based on certain provocations   example  d and v get in a barfight  d stabs v in the leg with a steak knife  unwittingly severing v s femoral artery  and v bleeds out in seconds  d certainly intended to seriously hurt v  but he did nt intend to kill him  but his intentional act nonetheless caused d s death   involuntary manslaughter  as the name implies  this is the unintentional taking of a human life  but  for such a killing to be criminally culpable  the defendant must have killed the victim in the course of some criminal act or with some level of criminal culpability  in the us  the lowest level of criminal liability is gross  criminal negligence  which is a higher standard than regular negligence you often encounter in civil cases   so if you kill someone as a result of your criminally negligent  reckless  or intentional conduct  you commit involuntary manslaughter   example  d is driving 90 mph through a residential neighborhood when he loses control of his car and strikes v in his front yard  killing him  here  d is almost certainly grossly negligent or reckless  and v died as a direct result of his actions  d has committed involuntary manslaughter   i hope this helps  please note that the examples are not perfect  some of them could arguably be chargeable as a different offense  and others may be subject to some defense or justification  the difference is intent  with murder  you either intended to kill someone  or acted in a reckless manner where a foreseeable consequence was death  manslaughter is acting reckless where death was not a foreseeable consequence  for example   shooting someone  murder  hard to say you pulled the trigger and did not expect that person to die  hitting someone with a bat  probably murder  even if you did not intend to kill  a bat is a deadly weapon  and you should have know death was possible  punching someone  who falls  hits their head  and dies  this is classic voluntary manslaughter  you committed an act of violence against a person that lead to their death by accident  running a red light  and causing a fatal accident  involuntary manslaughter  you did nt intend to hurt anyone specifically  but your negligence lets to a death you ve pretty much got it  manslaughter is accidental murder like killing someone in a car crash  basically  if you are charged with manslaughter  you killed someone  but you did nt mean to do it  voluntary manslaughter is when you intended harm  but not necessarily death  for example  you got into a fight with someone and punched them too hard ,0
its likely that ancient people discovered smoking by accident perhaps while trying to cook food over an open fire they may have noticed that certain plants when burned produced pleasant smells and flavors they may have also noticed that smoking these plants seemed to have a relaxing effect on the body over time people began to intentionally cultivate and smoke these plants as a way to enjoy their pleasant effects,1
the standard strength of massproduced hard liquor is 40 abv or alcohol by volume because this concentration is a good balance between the taste and potency of the alcohol nthere is no legal requirement for hard liquor to be 40 abv but many distilleries and breweries have settled on this concentration because it is a good compromise between the strength of the alcohol and the flavor of the drink nin general the higher the abv the stronger the flavor and the more potent the drink some people prefer stronger flavors and higher potencies while others prefer a more mild flavor and lower potency by producing hard liquor at 40 abv distilleries and breweries can appeal to a wide range of consumers who have different preferences nso while there is no specific legal or traditional reason for hard liquor to be 40 abv it has become a common and popular choice because it strikes a good balance between flavor and potency for many people,1
usually when a company uses a different name it is because they bought a company already established in that country  walkers was independent and lays bought them so the walkers name was already established  same thing for walls  frigo  ola they were all independent companies that were bought by unilever  sometimes it is because their name in english means something different in a different language  also the name could be trademarked in the other country by some other product  sometimes an established company may already have that name trademarked  for example  burger king goes by the name hungry jack s in australia  because when they entered the australian market  there was already a restaurant called burger king that had the name trademarked  so they had to come up with a new name ,0
a database model is a way of organizing and structuring data in a database it determines how data is stored related and accessed there are several different types of database models includingnnnnrelational model this model stores data in tables which are organized into rows and columns each row represents a record and each column represents a field the relational model is based on the mathematical concept of a relation which is a set of tuples rows with a unique identifier primary keynnnnhierarchical model this model stores data in a treelike structure with a parentchild relationship between records each record has a single parent record except for the root record which has no parentnnnnnetwork model this model is similar to the hierarchical model but allows multiple parentchild relationships between recordsnnnnobjectoriented model this model stores data as objects which are selfcontained units of data and behavior objects are organized into classes which define their properties and methodsnnnnentityrelationship model this model is used to represent the relationships between different entities such as customers orders and products in a database it is often used as a conceptual model and is then translated into a specific database model such as the relational modelnnnnchoosing the right database model for a particular application depends on the requirements of the application the amount and type of data and the expected workload,1
i d suspect  almost certainly  is quite a bit of an overstatement  i ve shocked myself at least two dozen times with the current coming from my wall  and while it hurts like a bitch  i ve never come close to dying  and while people  can  survive lightning strikes  i also suspect you have an overestimated view of how many people survive direct lightning strikes  it all depends on  how  you re being electrocuted  proximity  how the current flows through your body  etc  tldr  your adjectives seem backwards let me offer you the  hydraulic analogy of electricity   url7   plus some attempts to answer you  it is nt perfect  but it s very useful for understanding simple concepts of electricity  electric current  amperage  is like water flow  the greater the current  more electrons are  flowing   1 ampere  1 a  is equals to a flow rate of 1 coulomb per second  it does nt matter which direction electricity is flowing  it just means that through a given section of the conductor  there are 1 coulomb of charge passing through it per second  1 coulomb is the charge of about 6000000000000000000 electrons   electrons are tiny  a current of 1 ma  0001 a  passing through your heart directly is enough to fibrillate it  but the skin acts as an insulator  more on that below  so higher currents  50  100 ma  but up to 200 ma depending on some factors  are needed  1 ma is barely noticeable on the skin   i consulted  this   url8  and  this   url3   also  this   url2   electric shocks are less hazardous if taken for a brief moment  but around 10 ma is enough to make your muscles contract involuntarily  making you unable to drop an object that gave you a shock  it also hurts a lot  voltage is like pressure  or technically  a difference in pressure   pressure may  induce  flow  for example  water tends to flow from points of higher pressure to points of lower pressure  but it may be unable if something is blocking the flow  like a valve blocking water flow  keeping one side in high pressure and other side in lower pressure without letting water to pass   electrical current  flows  from higher voltage to lower voltage through the path of least resistance  just like water flows through the path of least resistance   electrical resistance is a property of bodies that relate how much current it lets pass for a given voltage  conductors  such as copper wire  have little resistance  meaning that they lets a lot of current pass for a given voltage  this means that if the current has the possibility to pass through wood  lots of resistance  or copper  little resistance   most will pass through copper  materials that can block the flow of electric current are called insulators  or dielectrics   they have high resistance  dry skin is an insulator  wet skin not so much  insulators are able to withstand some voltage letting very little current pass through them  but every material has some voltage in which it  breaks   ionizes  and let a lot of current to pass  like every valve has some pressure in which it ruptures and start letting a lot of water to pass   this is called  dielectric breakdown   url4   a more proper description requires some math  but it s not that scary   it turns out that in many practical cases  voltage and current are proportional  that is  if you double the voltage  you will double the current  the proportionality constant is the resistance  this is called  ohm s law   url5   if you divide voltage by current you ll get the resistance  that is  voltage  current  resistance equivalently  if you divide voltage by resistance you get the current current  voltage  resistance we measure resistance in ohms  1 ohm  or 1 î©  is the resistance of an object that  when subject to a voltage of 1 v  will let a current of 1 a pass through it  now  the question is  what s the resistance of human body  if we know that  we can calculate how much current will flow for a given voltage   here s an attempt at that   url0    here s the wikipedia stance   url8  bodyresistance  that cites  this study   url10   that link says dry skin resistance may be as high as 100000 î©  while wet skin has 1000 î© this would mean that when subject to 10 v  there would be a flow of 01 ma in the best case  which is harmless  to 10 ma in the worst case  which already causes pain   that s why you re able to hold the contacts of a 9 v battery without much trouble  but also  batteries have limited current   but there is more than that  because of two effects  first  resistance actually does vary with voltage  an example is the mentioned dielectric breakdown  which lower the resistance when a very high voltage is applied  second  under the skin there are a lot of tissues which conduct electricity  this makes the human body more like a capacitor  a capacitor is a conductor  such as muscle or nerves  surrounded by insulators  such as the skin   my post is already too long  but one hydraulic analogy for a capacitor is  a rubber membrane   url1  that stretches under water pressure  if water keeps flowing only in one direction  it stretches until its maximum and eventually blocks the flow  unless it ruptures   but if the flow keeps changing its direction  in and out  the rubber membrane lets the flow to be transmitted from one side to the other  in this case without actual water flowing  just the movement is transmitted   in electrical terms  a capacitor will let alternating current  ac  pass  while blocking direct current  dc   or in other words  it has a lower resistance in relation to ac voltage than it would to dc voltage  your body itself is like this  it lets ac current pass more easily than dc  effectively lowering your resistance when letting alternating current pass  making ac more dangerous  your mains electricity is ac  and batteries  or anything like laptops  cellphones  provides dc power and are generally safer  they also usually operates at lower voltage   that wikipedia article   here   url8  bodyresistance   provides a neat measuring of the resistance between the arms  with dry skin  when subject to 50 hz ac  us standard mains electricity   it varies with voltage and varies between different persons   the international electrotechnical commission gives the following values for the total body impedance of a hand to hand circuit for dry skin  large contact areas  50 hz ac currents  the columns contain the distribution of the impedance in the population percentile  for example at 100 v 50  of the population had an impedance of 1875î© or less13  it says that at 220 v  50  of people have a resistance of 1350 î© arm to arm  with dry skin  which gives a current of 185 ma  this means that when you have an electric shock on your mains electricity  if the path to the ground happens from one arm to another  you will have a current of about 180 ma  some of it passing through your heart  which may be enough to kill you  this does nt means that every mains shock will kill you  because the path might not be from your arm to another  i m sorry for this lengthy post  and i did nt even answer your question directly  but  this wikipedia article   url6  can come to rescue  air is a good insulator  it means that if a lightning passes through it  the applied voltage must be past of the breakdown point  ionizing the air  making it a conductor   if the air around the person is ionized  then it may have a lower resistance than the human body and most of the current will pass outside the body  this is called the  flashover effect   url9  and is responsible for many survivals  if the person is wearing a metallic object however  a lot of current will pass through it  causing severe burns  if the current hit the ground and the person is near  then some of it may pass through legs  which may offer less resistance than the ground   anyway  i do nt know if this explains your question or even if your statement is right  it s unlikely that the survival rate of lightning  reported as 70  to 90  in the wikipedia article  is actually lower than 220 v shocks  the article also notes that statistics does nt differentiate between the many types of injuries  since direct hits  which are more dangerous  are also rarer   it is unfair comparing injuries due to to lightning that hit somewhere close to you with injuries due to being in direct contact with mains electricity  you probably wo nt die if you touch 220  it all depends on what you touched it with and what your other body parts were touching  electricity always seeks the easiest path to ground  your body is not an easy path  but it will do in the absence if anything else  this is why one side of any circuit is usually grounded  it cuts the chances of electrocution in half  if you touch a grounded conductor  neutral or common   you re safe  the ungrounded conductor  hot or line  is what pokes you  but voltage is nt what hurts you  amperage is  half an amp across your heart is enough to stop it  if you hit a live wire with your leg  it will hurt  but you wo nt die  the electricity is going to go to ground via your foot  if you grab a wire with one hand and you re touching something attached to the ground with the other  that s bad  the electricity path could go through the heart at that instance  people survive lightning strikes because although lightning bolts are extremely high voltage  they are also extremely low amperage  plus  there are a number of scenarios where it would miss your heart ,0
the government has lots of money and building things creates lots of jobs as well as drives many other sectors  the houses are sold  i know they are empty but it s becauset eh people buying them are investing in one of the only real  safe   debatable  investment opportunity they have  real estate  so they buy these houses with the hope that the price will go up as the area gets more developed  the government is selling everyone on this idea by saying that there are still hundreds of millions of people in the country without houses who want to move to the city and it s true except no one is mentioning that most of them do nt have the money to buy these houses and instead it s mostly the middle class who is buying second and third houses for investment or to rent out  this all seems like a very terrible idea until you realize a couple things  first off these houses are being bought with cash a lot of the time  chinese have been saving very well for a long time and they are now spending  so if the markets crash the government is hoping it wo nt take down too much  it will just lower the amount of savings people have  not good of course but nothing like what happened to the usa  secondly  the country needs this building to continue so that the construction market does nt crash as huge numbers of the impoverished have jobs in this sector and if it crashes these people all lose their jobs and there goes the countries stability ast heyll have tens if not hundreds of millions of people out of work over night  thirdly  the country has huge amounts of money  they can build these cities with the hope that in the future they will become booming metropolises  if it does nt work  it is a waste of money but that s the one thing china has to waste right now  so yeah  it looks like a terrible idea but there is logic behind it  whether it will work is still to be seen  according to government stats and economic predictions  it s working great  according to many who are watching  the government is hiding what s going on and a crash is coming  either way it s an interesting time to be alive and in china  edit   what is preventing them    answered this vaguely above  to be clear  the houses are empty but they are nt without owners  it s like if you have a house in tampa and one in ny where you live  what s to stop homeless people from taking over your tampa house  it s yours  the police would nt be cool with it  as well  an interesting side note that is probably good for understanding what seems to be a complete lack of long term logic to all this  the people buying these houses are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on what amount to small appartments in the west  the prices are insane  far beyond the western cities in terms of how much they cost vs how much they make  and what i love about this  is they do nt actually own anything  it s a 70 year rental agreement they are buying  the government still owns the land so they are spending their life savings to rent three or four units at incredibly over valued prices and 70 years later they lose it all regardless  i asked a business lady i taught about this a couple years ago  she had just bought a new house  her second  and i asked what about in the future  her answer was  the house wo nt last more than 20 years anyway before it falls apart so i m not worried   the construction is so shit here that these buildings have a 20  30 year shelflife before they need to be rebuilt anyway  now your  ownership  of the house does entitle you to another in the building that is built on the spot but who knows if they ll have the money to rebuild all these houses again 30 years from now and if they do  who knows if the new houses will be big  small or anything about them  it s a truly beautiful and mind boggling insane system  i would hate to be a part of it but as someone sitting on the side watching  it s like some crazy never ending soap opera  this may not be suitable for five year olds  if anything is unclear  just ask  i saw a documentary about this once  the ghost towns where built in an attempt to keep the chinese economy booming  but it s to expensive to live there so the people simply ca nt afford it    link to documentary    url0  i ll take a shot at it  since the top comment does nt exactly have it correct  imagine a typical pair of fairly well  off chinese grandparents  they have one child  who is married to an only child  who has an only child  so they only have one grandchild  who has four grandparents  so chinese people ca nt really depend on their grandchildren to support them in old age  now  they have a bunch of money  what are they going to do with it  it s all in chinese currency  and china has some pretty strict controls on their currency  you ca nt just sell it all for dollars and buy us treasury funds  you have to invest it in china  and if you invest in the  safe  things in china  you wind up being able to buy less things later than you could now  so you take your money and you buy an apartment that is nt going to get filled for a decade or more  if you invested your money in safe ways  the money you spent on an apartment would nt be able to afford that apartment  so buying an empty apartment is a good financial idea  tldr chinese people have literally no better investment options than building an apartment and waiting for it to get filled ,0

braille was developed as a way for people who are blind or visually impaired to read and write the braille system uses a series of raised dots arranged in specific patterns to represent letters numbers and punctuation marksnneach letter of the alphabet is represented by a unique combination of six dots arranged in a grid the dots are arranged in patterns that can be felt with the fingertips allowing blind people to read by touchnnone reason that braille uses these unique dot patterns is that it is a very efficient system for reading and writing the patterns are easy to recognize and can be read quickly which is important when reading large amounts of textnnanother reason is that braille is a very compact system it uses a small number of dots to represent each letter which means that it takes up less space on a page this is important because it allows more text to be fit onto a single page making it easier for blind people to carry around and read books and other materialsnnoverall the unique dot patterns used in braille are an important part of the system because they make it efficient compact and easy to use for people who are blind or visually impaired,1
washing your hands with soap and hot water is more effective at removing dirt germs and bacteria because the heat can help to loosen and dissolve these substances making them easier to wash away cold water on the other hand is not as effective at removing these substances because it does not have the same ability to loosen and dissolve them soap is also more effective at removing dirt and germs when it is used with hot water because the soap molecules are able to work more effectively to trap and remove the dirt and germs in general it is best to use water that is warm but not too hot for handwashing because extremely hot water can be uncomfortable and can also cause your skin to become dry and irritated,1

when a broker does not have enough shares to short it means that the broker does not currently have access to enough shares of the specific stock that the trader wants to sell short short selling is a strategy in which an investor sells borrowed shares of a stock hoping to buy the shares back at a lower price in the future and profit from the difference however in order to sell shares that the investor does not own the investor must first borrow the shares from someone elseif the broker does not have enough shares available to borrow the trader will not be able to execute the short sale this can happen when the stock is in high demand and there are not enough shares available to borrow or if the brokers inventory of borrowed shares has already been fully loaned out in this case the trader may need to look for another broker who has access to the necessary shares or may need to wait until more shares become available when a broker does not have enough shares to short it means that the broker does not have access to enough shares of the particular stock that a client wants to sell short in order to sell a stock short a trader must borrow the shares from someone else and sell them on the market with the hope that the price will go down so that they can buy the shares back at a lower price and return them to the lender thus making a profit however if the broker does not have enough shares to lend to the trader the trader will not be able to sell the stock shortits worth noting that short selling is a highrisk strategy that carries a significant amount of risk when a trader sells a stock short they are essentially betting that the price will go down and if the price goes up instead the trader can lose a significant amount of money as a result short selling is not suitable for everyone and traders should carefully consider their risk tolerance and financial situation before attempting to sell a stock short,1
anyone can create a sub  reddit  and when you create a sub  you automatically are a moderator of it  existing moderators of a sub can add new moderators  so the moderators of each sub will have a policy of how  or if at all  new moderators are appointed  i m not aware of any subs that pay their moderators  certainly the moderators of this sub are nt  despite numerous accusations of being shills for all kinds of groups   do they get paid  i wish   how are they chosen  when a user creates a subreddit  anyone can create a subreddit  they become that subreddit s sole moderator  they can then add more moderators  and give those moderators the ability to add other moderators   who moderates them  the reddit admins  though they tend to be very hands  off  and only get involved when the reddit terms of service are being violated  or someone is breaking the law  the mods at r  toronto are astroturfers for olivia chow  the mayor candidate of that city  i was there at the reddit meet  up when this came up ,0
things with mass ca nt travel at the speed of light  radio waves  are  light  they re electromagnetic waves just like the light we see  but they have less energy  the same applies to microwaves  infrared  uv  x  rays and gamma rays  although the last three have more energy than visible light  radio waves travel at the speed of light because radio waves are a kind of light  also  the statement that  nothing can travel at the speed of light  should really be  only massless objects can travel at the speed at which light travels in a vacuum   to clarify  nothing can be accelerated to the speed of light  this is because it takes more energy to accelerate things faster and faster  you would need infinite energy to accelerate something to the speed of light and that is impossible  now radio waves is a form of electromagnetic radiation  just like microwaves  from your microwave oven or wifi   infra red  light  ultra violet  x  rays and gamma radiation  they re all carried by little particles we call photons  which already travel at the speed of light because they have no mass at rest    eli5   yes  radio waves are as fast as light as they are simply a different form of light  and nothing  with mass  can be accelerated to the speed of light  but light  and all variations  already travel at the speed of light  because it has no mass  ,0
mostly good ol sailing around and looking at the shape of it  not just captains  but pretty much everyone on the ship would have a pretty good eye for it  see how much land they passed  based on velocity as well  and people going to high places and looking at distinguishing features  cartographers  mapmakers  paid good money for that  and the chinese had sailboats hundreds of years before christ  if you can measure the coordinates  longitude and latitude  of points on earth  you can plot an accurate map by following the shore  taking measurements at various points  putting them on a map and connecting the points  the way i see it  the challenges to ancient map makers would have fallen under two categories  first  did they understand the shape of the earth accurately  you need to understand that the earth is a sphere  more or less  to make accurate large  scale maps that fit a whole continent  for example  somebody who believes that the the earth is flat is going to run into the problem that north  south lines are nt parallel â€” they meet at the poles  the ancient greeks figured out that the earth is  roughly  spherical  erathostenes and hipparchus had an understanding of longitude and latitude as well  a couple of centuries bc  admiral zheng he was a muslim  and islamic scholars had translated and taught ancient greek knowledge for centuries  so you can bet he knew this stuff  second challenge  did the ancients have a good way to measure the coordinates of a spot on earth  latitude is relatively easy  because you can figure it out from the sun or the stars  for example  you can use the angle between the horizon and the north star  but there was no accurate and reliable method of measuring longitude on land until the late 1600s  and longitude at sea did nt get solved until the late 1700s  before this  what people did was to guess the longitude using  a  distance from a known point   b  latitude and  c  an estimate of the size of the earth  these estimates  however  were wrong all the time  so when you look at any large  scale map made before 1650 or so  you can be pretty sure that the latitudes are right but the longitudes are wrong  if you re curious or adventurous  you see this easily by comparing old maps to modern ones  for example   in this r  mapporn comment i compare a 1635 map of africa to modern maps   url0   and the longitudes are wrong   the longitudes  as is to be expected  are way off  the map gets the longitude of the cap vert in senegal to within 1 degree  but it has the easternmost tip of africa at 80 degrees east of tenerife  635 east of greenwich   when it is in fact about 665 degrees east of tenerife  51 degrees east of greenwich   he has the cape of good hope at about 235 east greenwich  when it is 185 east  fernando po at 135 east greenwich instead of the real 87 east  if you really want to know and can read better than a five year old  what you really want is this  url0 your local public library should have it  great book  a very nice mixture of non  fiction information with enough fun anecdotes about those pioneers to keep the book lively ,0

perpetual motion is a hypothetical concept that refers to a machine or system that can operate indefinitely without any external energy input while it may seem like a good idea to build a perpetual motion machine it is actually impossible because it violates the laws of thermodynamicsrnrnthe first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed only converted from one form to another this means that any machine or system that tries to operate indefinitely without any external energy input must be able to convert some other form of energy into the energy it needs to keep running however this is not possible because all energy conversions involve some loss of energyrnrnfor example lets say you build a machine that uses solar panels to power an electric car the solar panels will convert sunlight into electricity which will be used to charge the cars battery the battery will then be used to power the cars electric motor this system will work as long as there is sunlight but it will eventually run out of energy and stop working this is because the solar panels can only convert a certain amount of sunlight into electricity and some of that energy is lost during the conversion processrnrnin summary perpetual motion is not possible because it violates the laws of thermodynamics while it may be possible to build a machine or system that can operate for a long time using renewable energy sources like solar panels or wind turbines it will eventually run out of energy and stop working,1

dry firing a bow or releasing the string without an arrow can be harmful because the bow is designed to release the energy stored in the limbs when an arrow is shot when you dry fire a bow that energy has nowhere to go and it can cause damage to the bow itself or even break the bownnadding an arrow changes the weight of the bow because the arrow has mass and adds weight to the bow when it is shot the energy stored in the limbs is then transferred to the arrow propelling it forward this helps to distribute the energy in a way that is safe for the bow and the shooternnthink of it like this if you have a rubber band and you stretch it out and let it go it will snap back quickly and release all of its energy at once if you have something attached to the rubber band like a paper clip the energy from the rubber band will be transferred to the paper clip as it is released and the rubber band will not snap back as quickly or as strongly this is similar to how an arrow helps to absorb some of the energy from the bow when it is shot,1
if you are buying any product  such as airline tickets  where you believe there is any possibility you may develop a dispute later  make sure to use credit not debit  as your ability to dispute is increased  large or fragile purchases  credit is required  a hamburger that you will eat in the next five minutes  debit is okay  i speak from recent personal experience that debit card disputes are hell  i had to spend 7 months of my life going to small claims court after the debit bank s dispute policy was so ineffective and produced no refund   i won in court   many here are forgetting that debit cards often also function as a visa credit card  so  let s make sure we re talking about the right kind of account  there are checking accounts and credit accounts  and both can be accessed both ways   it s a little trickier to access a credit account like a debit card  but i believe can be set up  i ve never tried  because the fees are awful   there s also a difference in security  depending how far you trust your bank    checking accounts   accessed as debit  the bank may charge you a fee  the merchant has no control over this  and likely does nt have any way of knowing if there will be a fee   ask your bank   money is gone from your checking account right away  no need to pay off later  no risk of missing a payment and suffering fees  accessed as credit  the bank charges the vendor a small fee  money is gone right away  no paying bills later    credit accounts   accessed as credit  bank  credit company charges the vendor a small fee  a transaction posts  recording that you must pay the creditor back later  if you miss a payment or pay late  you suffer huge penalties  accessed as debit  this is either rare or nonexistent  it would post as a money forward and probably have its own interest rate  nobody wants to do this    note on security   if your credit account gets compromised  criminals can use it up to its credit limit  which hopefully is less than the amount in your bank account  you would report the fraud  and the creditor would hopefully cancel the transactions   important part  before you lost the money  if the creditor is uncooperative  they must approach you to demand the stolen funds  and you can say no   and suffer bad credit scores   if you are using your debit card as a visa and that number gets compromised  the criminal can run you for the entire contents of your checking account  you would then report the fraud  and the bank  should  have a policy in place that they have to reverse the transactions  but until they finish this process you are left without your money  the process might take a few weeks  in the meantime  you might be unable to do important things like pay rent and bills  because your actual money has been taken   vs fraudulent transactions simply telling your creditor that your money should be taken  at a future date   for the above reason  i never  ever use my debit card in any system where the card number gets stored or any person other than myself gets to hold the card where i ca nt see how it s being used  all anyone needs is an extra swiper to capture the info on the magnetic strip  or even just a cell phone camera to quickly remember the numbers  and online  well  i do nt think there are any companies left that i ve done business with whose databases of financial info have nt been stolen by hackers   steam  adobe  playstation network  xbox live  etc  etc  etc  all the way down to the dorm i stayed in during college   tl  dr  debit means you do nt have to pay later  but there might be a fee  credit sticks the merchant with the fee  if it s a credit card  you have to remember to pay later  never use your debit card s visa number to buy things online  i feel like people are missing the point of the question  it s not  what is the difference between a credit card and a debit card    he  she is asking  what is the difference when a store runs a debit card through as debit vs running it through as credit  ,0
russia and ukraine are two countries located in eastern europe for many years they were part of the same country called the soviet union which was a communist country that was made up of several different republics after the soviet union fell apart in 1991 ukraine and russia became two separate countries in recent years there has been some tension between the two countries because of a disagreement over a region called crimea crimea is a peninsula that is located on the black sea and is home to many people who speak russian as their first language in 2014 russia annexed crimea which means that they took control of the region and made it a part of russia however ukraine and many other countries do not recognize crimea as part of russia and consider it to be an occupied territory this disagreement has caused tension between russia and ukraine and there have been some conflicts between the two countries as a result,1
if a site is nt based in the us they have no obligation to comply with us law  most sites just sign up to an advertising service and then that service places ads on the site  well  known companies  brands often have no ability to choose where there ads appear  i feel like the only ads i ever see on torrent sites is  how i can make my dick bigger with just one simple trick   or  make 237a day  or  click here your wife will never know  the short answer for 99  of these sites  the us government just does nt care enough  most onion sites  streaming sites  piracy sites  save maybe tpb   etc  fall under this category  the us government really just does nt care enough to bust them  but if they wanted to they would  see  tsr  kim dotcom   sure  a lot of these sites are run by  and hosted by  citizens in countries where piracy is not a priority  eg russia   again though  the real reason is just because they do nt really care that much  despite possible rhetoric to the contrary  ,0

in many video games the game uses a seed number to generate different worlds or game environments this seed number is used to create a specific pattern or set of rules that the game follows to create the world so if you use the same seed number the game will generate the same world every time but if you use a different seed number the game will generate a different worldnnimagine that you are making a cake and you have a recipe that tells you all of the ingredients you need and how much of each ingredient to use the recipe is like the seed number in a game because it tells the game how to create the world if you follow the recipe exactly your cake will turn out the same way every time but if you change the recipe by using different ingredients or using different amounts of ingredients your cake will be different its the same with the seed number in a game  it tells the game how to create the world and if you change the seed number the game will create a different world,1
small cage is cruel because the animal is alive and do not live in an environment that lets it have a good life  small enough it is suffering  killing it is swift and after that the animal is no longer alive so the cutting it up and all that is nt worth talking about  there are discussions about how we kill animals of course  personally i think it is fucked that we kill for enjoyment  i can understand for food more even if i do nt agree but the fact that we are focusing on it at all is a big step forward  if a person is asked if he s from a certain gaming forum for the rest of his life  that s cruel  a cannibal killing and eating another person piece by piece afterwards is nt usually considered cruel  what is cruel is if that cannibal cut off pieces of meat to eat while the person was still alive  it s all about the quality of life the animal had when it was alive  we want to eat happy cows and chickens ,0
nutrition is very complex with the effect of diet on the body being confused by a number of other factors in an individuals lifestyle  with the more traditional sciences you can much more easily isolate individual components to look at them alone  diet and health is a place where it s hard to experiment on people  due for example to ethics concerns  and to simple logistics  it s hard to lock a sizable set of people up for a couple of years in order to be sure about what they re eating  and if you think a particular diet is actually bad for people it s difficult to get approval to feed it to them for long enough to show this  that s an ethical issue  so it s a good place for a natural experiment or observational study  you ask people what they eat  and try to correlate that with health effects  sadly  people lie about what and how much they eat  both knowingly and unknowingly  virtually no one can report truthfully on how much they ate  certainly not for long periods of time  so  it s just difficult  and the problem itself is tricky  there s evidence that  calories in  calories out  is not really a good model  i think  your body s efficiency ramps up and down depending on it going into fat storage mode  and other complicated effects  i think this is a place where a lot of progress will be made in the next twenty years  if we can turn metabolisms up and down  so you can in essence have the metabolism of a teenager whenever you want it  weight problems can be an issue of the past  of course  what kind of health effects will that cause  i m not one hundred percent  but from what i gather  there is definitely concrete science in it  but then a lot of opinion because different people require different nutrition ,0
when graphing parabolas  the x and y coordinates can be expressed with the general formula y  ax2bxc  known as a  quadratic equation   when you plug in specific numbers for a  b  and c  it will affect how the parabola looks   try moving the sliders here  and see how changing each parameter  a  b  and c are called  parameters   affects the final look of the parabola    url1  one common question with parabolas is  where  if any place  does the parabola cross the x axis   the location of x axis can be described very simply  y  0  wherever y0  you ll find the x axis there  so  to plot the points on a graph on graph only on the x axis  we replace y with 0 in the formula to get  ax2bxc0 even when you re given a specific a  b  and c for that formula  it s not very user  friendly when trying to find what x is when y0  a better approach would be to rearrange the formula so that x is on one side  and all the other variables are on the other side  then you could just plug in a  b  and c  and find out x right away   let s ask wolframalpha to rearrange ax2bxc0 for us so that x is on one side  and you ll see that we get the quadratic formula    url0  you might want to click on the  step  by  step solution  button to see how wolframalpha got from here to there  also  note that you only get the quadratic formula if the formula is set equal to 0   if you set the formula to equal  say  3  you get something completely different    url2  so  the quadratic equation is just the parabola formula rearranged to make it easier to find out where  if any place  the parabola crosses the x  axis   when playing around with various values for a  b  and c here   url1   you can see not only how they change the look of the parabola  but where the parabola crosses the x axis  if any place   it can cross  as you can see  at 2 places  1 place  or no place   this is a better question than most can appreciate  they mean absolutely nothing and the equation is completely meaningless until everyone knows what a  b and c are  typically is it best practice to start out with an equation like  ax2   bx   c   0 and then to follow it up with the equation that expresses the solutions for x as x   quadratic equation goes here  great question  each letter represents a portion of a quadratic equation in standard form  ax2  bx  c for example  3x2  6x  1  a  3  b  6  c  1,0
flat is a good a word as any since it s one of the few ways we can even attempt to visualize it  if you imagine two 2d circle creatures living on a sheet of paper  they can see only a small amount of one another  in order to see all of one creature s surface  the other creature would have to walk around him  or ask him to spin  obviously they would never see inside each other unless one of them opened up and accidentally became a line  but looking down at them  you  a 3d creature  can see all sides of them  their entire circumference  both inside and out  likewise  us 3d creatures can only see one side of another 3d creaure at a time  and usually only the outside  if a creature who lived in 4 space  like dimensions were looking at you  he could see both your face and the back of your head  both your outside and insides at the same time  this is far beyond our comprehension  even the idea of it  looking  like something just illustrates how lacking we as a species are for having a stronger vocabulary for visualizing the physical structure of the fourth dimension without going into too much detail  that would depend on how our 3d world is embedded in side the 4d world  that is  the geometric properties of  say  a piece of paper change depending on if the paper is lying flat on a table  or curled up into a cylinder  although in both cases it would be a 2d object embedded in 3d space   the following is nt going to be quite at a 5  year  old level  i m afraid   for example  it s fun to try and visualize a 3  sphere in 4  dimensional space  just as a 2  sphere  ie an ordinary sphere in our 3  dimensional world  is the boundary of a solid 3  dimensional ball  a 3  sphere is the boundary of a solid 4  dimensional ball  such a sphere can be described as the set of points equidistant from some single fixed point in 4  dimensional space  and there are various details one needs to work out but the point is that this description leads to a pretty neat way of visualizing a bit of what s going on in 4d space  imagine a tennis ball in 3d space  and fix your  xyz  axes straight through the center  take cross sections of the tennis ball at different values of z  more technically  as you translate your xy  plane along the z  axis  take the intersection of the tennis ball with the plane   you can assume that the tennis ball has radius 1  you will find that  as you move from z1 in the positive z  direction your cross sections start as a single point  then widening to give you circles of increasing width until you get to z0  where the circle in your cross section reaches its maximum radius  ie 1   as you move past z0  the circle decreases in radius until finally at z1 your cross section is a single point again  these cross sections  in turn  end up completely determining the tennis ball  if you were given only these cross sections and their corresponding z  coordinates  then all you have to do to reconstruct the tennis ball is just stack up the cross sections in the right order  as determined by their z  coordinates  notice that these cross sections are snapshots of 1  dimensional objects  circles  in 2  dimensional space  the xy  planes that we took the cross sections with   in a completely analogous fashion we can construct the 3  sphere  which lives in 4  dimensional space  using snapshots of 2  dimensional objects in 3  dimensional space  take your four axes  say   xywz   in 4  space  and for each value of z as you go from 1 to 1  you have cross sections of the 3  sphere using the xywplane   i put the word plane in quotes because it s actually 3  dimensional    just as you sliced into the tennis ball at various heights with 2  dimensional planes  you are slicing into the 3  sphere at various  heights  with 3  dimensional  planes   what do these slices look like  just as your tennis ball slices  as you went from z1 to z1  looked like a point widening to a circle that expanded until it had radius 1 and then contracted back down into a point again  your slices of the 3  sphere  as you go from z1 to z1  look like a point expanding to a 2  sphere  just the usual familiar sphere that we know  which keeps expanding until a maximum radius of 1  and then contracts back down to a point  another way to visualize this is to just restrict yourself to 3  dimensional space and use time as the 4th dimension  and say that you have a point at time z1 which expands to a sphere  the sphere keeps expanding as time passes  until it reaches its maximum radius of 1 at time z0  after which it starts contracting until it turns back into a point at time z1   i dislike this last method because it s kind of a cop  out which tends to obscure the raw geometry of the thing you re studying   when you stack all of these cross sections together  the totality of the resulting object is a 3  sphere  anyways i hope that was even just a little bit interesting  useful to you ,0
they use really big cams that do not make power until a certain high rpm  its called the power band  at low rpms the cam is nt working efficiently  most drag car cam s power band might be from 3000rpms to 7000rpms  drag cars  right before the green light will raise their rpms to the power band which is where the cam is designed to run check out hydroplane boat motors  their cams are so huge that they actually go back and forth from high  revved to nearly stopped at idle  over and over again  same thing  smaller engine  i ve heard it called  lobing  large overlap and high lift cams  the engine essentially has a massive vacuum leak at idle  which goes away due to flow characteristics  allowing more air in the cylinder and more exhaust out ,0
area 51 is  was a military base in southern nevada where the military tests  tested its latest and greatest military technology  planes like the sr71 blackbird and b2 stealth bomber were tested here  before anyone had ever seen anything like these planes  because of this  people would occasionally catch a glimpse of some new tech like this flying in the air  and be unable to identify what it was  unidentified flying object   because the military was nt about to tell people what they were looking at  top secret  they made really bad  lazy lies about what these sightings were of  weather balloons  swamp gas etc    because of how bad or boring these lies tended to be  many people assumed they were covering up aliens  the most famous event being the roswell  new mexico crash in 1947  the government says it was a top secret surveillance balloon for project mogul meant for early detection of soviet ballistic missiles  people instead preferred to believe it was an alien crash that the government covered up  area 51 is the code name for a highly classified military base inside the nellis afb bombing range in southern nevada  ufologists  yes  that s a thing  and government conspiracy theorists say it houses and is used to test and reverse engineer advanced alien technology  a more realistic explanation is that its used to test top secret aircraft and other things the government does nt want getting out  the government has allowed  or even perpetuated  the ufo mythology around it to distract away from the real work that goes on there  url0 url1 area 51 is a us air force base in nevada  it has existed since world war ii  but was not officially acknowledged publicly by the us government until 1995  over the years  area 51 has been involved in testing for experimental aircraft of various types and other highly classified projects  because it is so secretive  it has become the subject of many conspiracy theories  including ones about ufos  the roswell ufo incident  in roswell  new mexico  is another source of conspiracy theories that is commonly mixed up with area 51 ,0
poor posture such as slouching can cause back muscle pain because it puts strain on the muscles of the back when you slouch your muscles have to work harder to hold you up which can cause them to feel tired and sore its like carrying a heavy backpack on one shoulder all day it can make your muscles tired and sore good posture on the other hand helps your muscles work more efficiently which can help prevent muscle pain,1
in the uk members of parliament mps in the house of commons and the house of lords will often express their approval or disapproval of a speaker or a statement being made by shouting clapping or making other noises this is a way for mps to show their support or opposition to something that is being said and it can also be a way for them to try to influence the debate or the outcome of a vote sometimes mps will cheer or clap to show their support for a speaker or a statement while at other times they may grumble or boo to express their disapproval this can be a way for mps to make their feelings known and it can also create a sense of drama and excitement in the chamber in the us congress this type of behavior is less common but it does still happen on occasion members of congress may cheer clap or boo to show their support or opposition to something that is being said but this is generally not done as frequently as it is in the uk parliament,1

the best i can do to simplify it  the fine bros have decided that they will attempt to trademark the format of the  react video   which given the permission  will allow them to have the power to lay claim to any video that they decide is too close to their format  anyone  reacting  in their videos is now part of the fine bros  react worldtm   two massive problems come from this situation    1  the  react format  is too broad  and actually unknown  and yet the fine bros look as though they might succeed in getting the rights to this undefinable  thing   imagine if tomorrow  warner bros were to create the  rock world  project  announcing that they own the concept of  rock   such a massive genre that it is impossible to truly define  therefore  warner bros would be able to take action on just about anything with a guitar in it  because it is  too rock  like   making up the rules as they go along  subsequently  many  many musicians will be under the label s watchful eyes  in danger of legal action  the  react format  is so unspecified to the point that the fine bros could have the right to take legal action against anyone discussing a video  or even dares have someone else s video playing in the corner at the same time  in spite of the fact that they have spent the last few days posting comments and even an  update  video in their own defence  they still have nt stated what they are truly claiming  meaning it seems more and more as though they are claiming more than they deserve    2  reaction videos existed before the fine bros did it     if the definition is so broad  they can also lay claim to videos that existed before theirs did  this was what their original  react world  announcement video was about  announcing that if you made a  react video   that you were part of their community  the reason that announcement clip was so stupid was that it treated the announcement as though it were good news  good news everyone  you ve just been employed by the fine bros  although if you do nt want our name on your video  that s ok  just give us some money for a license and you are safe  going back to the music comparison  that is similar to warner bros hoping that all guitarists would suddenly be happy about that  rock world  project  because they had been signed by warner bros  unfortunately  not all guitarists  nor video makers are that stupid  leading to the big backlash  an eli5 post that does nt explain anything or even states the problem  what is the purpose  so why is it possible to have the jimmy fallon show  the conan show and the jimmy kimmel show and they all seem to have the same format  yet the fine bros can do  or try to do  what they are doing ,0
its important to note that robbery including notepassing robbery is a serious crime that involves taking something of value such as money by force or threat of force this type of crime is not acceptable and can have serious consequences for the person committing the robbery and for the victimrnrnin the case of a notepassing robbery the perpetrator may present a note to a teller at a bank or other financial institution stating that they have a weapon and demanding money even if the perpetrator is not actually armed the threat of violence can be enough to make the victim comply with the demand for moneyrnrnbanks and other financial institutions have procedures in place for handling robberies including giving the perpetrator a certain amount of money in order to reduce the risk of violence and protect the safety of employees and customers this does not mean that the bank or financial institution is condoning the crime or encouraging it in any way it is simply a way to try to defuse the situation and minimize harm,1
there are pros and cons to both renting and buying a home and the decision ultimately depends on your individual financial situation and personal preferences here are some things to considerif you have a lot of debt and the housing market is rising it may be tempting to buy a home and roll your debt into a mortgage this can potentially help you to reduce your monthly debt payments as the interest rate on a mortgage is typically lower than the interest rates on other types of debt such as credit card debt however its important to carefully consider the total cost of homeownership including property taxes insurance maintenance and repairs if youre not able to afford these additional costs you may end up in a worse financial situation than if you had rented and paid off your debt more slowlyon the other hand if youre able to afford the total cost of homeownership and youre confident that youll be able to make your mortgage payments it may make sense to buy a home owning a home can provide a sense of stability and can also be a good investment if the housing market continues to riseif youre not sure what to do it may be helpful to speak with a financial planner or a housing counselor to help you make an informed decision they can review your financial situation and help you to determine the best course of action for your specific circumstances there are pros and cons to both renting and buying and the decision ultimately depends on your individual circumstances here are a few things to considerrenting renting can be a good option if you dont have a down payment saved up or if youre not sure you want to commit to living in one place for a long period of time renting can also be less expensive in the short term because you dont have to worry about maintenance costs or property taxes however its important to remember that you wont be building any equity in a rented property so you wont have any asset to show for your paymentsbuying buying a home can be a good option if you have a stable income and good credit and youre planning to stay in one place for a while a mortgage can allow you to roll your debt into your monthly payments which can make it easier to manage your finances however buying a home can be a significant financial commitment as youll need to save up for a down payment and be prepared for ongoing costs like property taxes insurance and maintenanceultimately the decision to rent or buy will depend on your individual circumstances and financial goals it may be helpful to consult with a financial planner or a mortgage lender to explore your options and determine the best course of action for you,1

microphones can and do repeat what they hear  and if the hear louder than the speakers are putting the sound out  you ll get a feedback loop and hear that horrible ringing sound you hear so frequently with indie bands  keys to reducing the effect   use a directional  cardiod pattern is a very common semi  directional mic  however other patterns such as supercardiod exist too  microphone and point it away from the speakers  do nt set the sensitivity of the mic  or the gain  too high  or you ll risk creating positive feedback  software can  remember  what it put out of the speakers and subtract a large part of the unintended signal that it would become part of microphone s signal  it does two things  1  it has cancellation that actually tracks the sounds that come in through the mic and omits that sound it if is heard again soon thereafter  this prevents feedback and echo and repetition  2  they stop playing sound when they are receiving sound  this is less and less common as cancelling gets better and better  but  old speaker phones all did this  they were essentially one  way  at  a  time  many microphones are directional  and so will only repeat what comes through the speakers if pointed at them  other systems  like skype  know what the speaker is saying  and so remove it from the microphone feed  but microphones can and do do this  it s called feedback  if you ever get the chance  hold a microphone right up to a speaker  it will start to whine louder and louder ,0
rap is a specific musical style  hip  hop is more of a culture  which can also include dance  art and fashion etc  kind of like bluegrass vs country  hip  hop music originally hip  hop music developed containing essentially three ingredients  breaks  beats and scratches  this has evolved over the years  for example breaks used to be snippets of james brown records and short soul samples  this has changed to people like parliament and funkadelic  and the previous short samples have been replaced by major chunks of the original song mixed into the new record  scratches have been almost totally removed due to the demise of the dj in hip  hop records  this may have more to do with rappers realizing that they can do without a dj in most cases and still make the same money  beats however have not changed dramatically and therefore are the heart of hip  hop music  rap music rap can be roughly defined as words spoken rhythmically  in modern days it can be added that these words are spoken over a beat  with it s origins in africa it should be understood that rap has been around a lot longer than hip  hop s seventeen years  a rapper may rap over a soul  backing track  or even a heavy metal rock track but this could not be hip  hop music  the artist may have originated through hip  hop culture but the music he is making is soul  rap or rock  rap fusion  not hip  hop  for a record to be a hip  hop record it would need to be primarily hip  hop beats rap has a more hard edge and hardcore lrics  while hip hop has a more r  bish feel  it has more of a groove to it  hip hop has more of a crossover appeal  but as far as lyricism  it deals with a lot of the same issues hip hop is more of a culture and rap is just a genre of music that has emerged from it  you have to first understand that nothing is truly original  they are similar because they likely have evolved from similar origins  hip  hop can even be described as an umbrella of music  rap can be hip  hop but hip  hop can not be rap  so they may not be wrong  but the most prominent difference without nit picking would be that rap describes an oral form of music  not necessarily joined with a beat ,0
facebook is valuable because it has a large user base and a strong brand many people use facebook to connect with their friends and family and businesses use facebook to advertise their products and services when businesses advertise on facebook they are willing to pay facebook money because they know that a lot of people use the platform and they want to reach as many of those people as possible facebook is able to charge a lot of money for advertising because it has a lot of information about its users which helps businesses target their ads to the right people this is why facebook is able to make a lot of money even though it doesnt sell any products,1
human beings are not particularly slow when it comes to running speed compared to other mammals in fact humans are actually quite fast compared to many other animals when it comes to running short distances however there are a few reasons why humans may not be as fast as some other mammals when it comes to running long distancesnnone reason is that humans have evolved to be more efficient at walking and running long distances rather than being very fast runners over short distances this means that humans can sustain their running speed for a longer period of time but may not be as fast as animals that are built for short bursts of speednnanother reason is that humans have relatively short legs compared to their body size which means that they have to take more steps to cover the same distance as an animal with longer legs this can make humans appear slower even though they are actually running at the same speednnfinally humans have a lot of weight that is not supported by their legs such as their head and upper body this extra weight can make it more difficult for humans to run as fast as animals that are built more like runners with a leaner body and longer legsnnso overall humans are not necessarily slow runners but they have evolved to be more efficient at running long distances rather than being very fast over short distances,1
in canada credit cards are a type of payment card that allows consumers to make purchases on credit when you use a credit card you are borrowing money from the credit card issuer to pay for your purchases you can then pay back the borrowed funds plus interest at a later datethere are many different types of credit cards available in canada including cards that offer rewards programs low interest rates and cards designed for specific purposes such as travel or balance transfers credit cards may also have annual fees which are charges that are assessed each year for the use of the cardto get a credit card in canada you generally need to apply for one from a credit card issuer this typically involves filling out an application form and providing information about your income credit history and financial situation the credit card issuer will use this information to determine whether you are eligible for a credit card and if so what type of card and credit limit you may be offeredit is important to note that using credit cards can be a convenient way to pay for purchases but it is also important to use them responsibly this means paying your credit card balances in full and on time each month to avoid incurring interest charges and damaging your credit score if you are unable to pay your credit card balances in full each month it is important to choose a card with a low interest rate to minimize the cost of borrowing,1

would nt the attendance be a better gauge as to how popular the movie is it would  but that s not why the data is being recorded and made public  revenue is reported back to the studios so the studios can know how the movie is doing  the studios care about revenue  not ticket sales because they want to know if they ll make their money back  the media takes that date  generated and intended for use by the movie s creators  and uses it to tell the public how popular a movie is  the data is being used as a proxy  and you re right  ticket sales would be better but no one is generating that information and making it public  while ticket sales would be a better measure of how popular a movie is  it would not tell the studios about revenue and it s revenue they care to know about  since it s the studios paying to obtain this data  it s their that priories matter  not necessarily  the gauge of how well a movie did is a matter of how much money it made versus how much it cost to produce  a cheap film with half the attendees of a feature film may be doing  better   revenue answers the question  was it worth making this film   in addition to the other answers  reporting box office receipts prevents studios from padding the results with either free or discount tickets to make a poor movie look better ,0
a few reasons  first  much of the electronics of the early space programs were analog  like old timey radios with a dial you could twist  or a cheapo washing machine  that kind of electronics does nt need much computational power  second  space travel did nt actually require a lot of advanced computation  oxygen level detection does nt need a fancy computer  orbital calculations were pre  programmed  not calculated on the fly  radios were analog  control systems were the main digital component  and they were simple  third  complex systems are often more prone to failure  better to have  it was thought  well trained humans that could use brain power to actuate simpler systems  than have complex computers running everything  remember  every electrical connection has a chance of coming loose during the vibration of lift off  consider a modern space game  that game might need to keep track of the position of thousands of objects  and millions of polygons  the apollo missions needed to keep track of   one single object    the spacecraft itself  slide rulers and tons of guys who earned physics degrees after taking advantage of the gi bill  the shortest answer is that because computers were slower they were only used for  important  things  like doing hard math quickly  since they were relied upon to do less  we did not expect them to do as much  also  when a computer is designed to do only one or two things it can leave out the machinery to do the things it does not need to do  today s computers are designed to do as much as possible  this gives them more power than is actually required  the computers used to reach the moon would have been designed to only do things required to go to the moon ,0
fractals are a strange thing  the easiest way to understand this would be to first take a look at this gif  url0 fractals are kind of a never  ending picture  where the entire picture is comprised of smaller and smaller versions of the larger picture  as you keep zooming in on the bigger patrick  you get closer to the smaller patrick  then  as you keep zooming in  yet another even smaller patrick appears in the already small patrick  it is never ending  imagine a spiders web which has water droplets on it because it rained   like so    url0  each water droplet has a reflection of the web and the other water droplets in it  so if you are looking into one of the droplets you are looking at the whole web and all droplets  which means you are looking at the whole web from a certain perspective  imagine if you switched your perspective by looking closer  zooming you view in   even as you switched your perspective you would still see the same thing  which is the whole web and all the water droplets  hope this helps  take a stick  put a stick half it s length at the middle of the first  pointing out  take a third stick half of the second stick s length  and do the same for the second stick  repeat forever  when you zoom in and out  it will look the same the entire time ,0

when it smells like rain you are smelling the earths natural clean scent rain itself doesnt have a smell but when it falls to the ground it can pick up various scents and particles from the air and the ground one of the most common scents associated with rain is the smell of petrichor which is the name for the unique earthy scent that is produced when rain falls on dry soil npetrichor is produced by a chemical reaction that occurs between the rainwater and certain compounds that are found in the soil when it rains the water seeps into the ground and comes into contact with these compounds which are released into the air as a gas this gas has a distinctive earthy smell that many people find pleasant nso when you smell the rain you are actually smelling the natural clean scent of the earth this scent is produced by the rain reacting with the soil and releasing certain compounds into the air,1
bugs like fruit flies are attracted to sweet and ripe fruits and they are also attracted to the smells of humans they are also attracted to warm moist environments when you are on vacation you may be eating sweet fruits or other foods that attract fruit flies and they may be drawn to the smells of your body additionally if you are in a warm humid location this may also attract fruit flies nfruit flies do not intentionally try to annoy humans they are simply drawn to things that they are attracted to such as sweet smells and warm moist environments they may also be attracted to any moist or sweet substances that are left out such as open containers of soda or fruit nif you want to avoid attracting fruit flies you can try to keep your surroundings clean and free of sweet or moist substances that might attract them you can also try using insect repellents or fly swatters to help keep them away,1

when you make ice  cream  as it freezes the mixture is stirred constantly  this adds a lot of air to the mix  and keeps the ice crystals very small  when you thaw ice cream and refreeze it  the air escapes and much larger crystals are formed  this is why it tastes more icy and less smooth   so sad  the texture of ice cream depends on the types of crystals that form to make the ice part when it freezes  you get different crystals based on the time it takes to freeze  how cold the actual medium is that freezes it  and a few other factors  when you pull it out of the fridge and refreeze it you are changing the crystal structure  the structure of the ice crystals  how they fit together  determines the texture of your ice cream  large crystals  grainy  small crystals  smoothe the churning is not for air  it s because it s literally breaking up any of the larger bonds of small crystals while it s freezing  churning prevents the small crystals from turning into big crystals while they freeze  if anything  it s working air out of the system by churning because water has this cool property that  when it freezes  the new formation of the molecules causes it to become less dense and have very tiny pockets of air in it  this is because of the shape of the molecule  if you are forming bigger crystals  you have more of these pockets and thus more air in the mixture  it s not about air at all  the actual  ice crystals  that you are getting on ice cream  the super gross white ice crystals on top of the ice cream when you do nt eat it forever  is condensation  this could be from a wet spoon  moisture in the air  not as likely   or even from you breathing down into the ice cream  source  url0  see  what gives ice cream its creamy texture   if you melt ice cream and then put it into an ice cream maker to refreeze while being churned  will the constant stirring help it taste good again  or is there a chemical change that prevents it ,0
sure screwdrivers are tools that we use to turn screws which are special types of bolts that have a spiral groove on them there are two main types of screwdrivers phillips head and flat head the phillips head screwdriver has a crossshaped tip that fits into a screw with a crossshaped indentation the indentation is called a phillips head the phillips head screwdriver is designed to be more resistant to slipping out of the screw when youre turning it the flat head screwdriver has a straight flat tip that fits into a screw with a straight flat indentation the indentation is called a flat head the flat head screwdriver is less likely to slip out of the screw than the phillips head screwdriver but it can be harder to turn because the tip doesnt fit as snugly into the screw so both types of screwdrivers have their own advantages and disadvantages the phillips head screwdriver is better at staying in the screw but it can be harder to turn the flat head screwdriver is easier to turn but it can slip out of the screw more easily people usually use whichever type of screwdriver is best suited for the screws they are working with,1
there are a few reasons why increasing the memory on an iphone might be more expensive than buying a microsd card for another device first iphones are made to be very slim and compact so there isnt a lot of room inside the phone for things like memory cards this means that the memory chips used in iphones have to be smaller and more compact than the ones used in other devices which makes them more expensive to produce second iphones are made by apple a company that is known for producing highquality products and charging premium prices for them this means that even if the cost of the raw materials and manufacturing processes is similar to those of other devices apple still has to charge more for their products in order to maintain their brand and profitability finally when you buy an iphone you are paying not just for the hardware but also for the software ios and the services like the app store that come with it these additional features and services add to the overall cost of the phone so while it might be cheaper to buy a microsd card for another device the cost of adding more memory to an iphone is higher because of the other factors that go into making and selling the phone,1
is actually not that hard to make oxygen  they have a readily available supply of water in the form of what they bring from earth  plus what they can save from their waste material  and yes that includes feces  and what the iss can save from the humidity in the air  a bit of this water is then processed through electrolysis and separated into hydrogen and oxygen  i  do nt really know what they do with the hydrogen after that  though  but the oxygen is circulated through the iss  the iss does nt need new oxygen because oxygen is actually conserved  all they need to do is remove the co2 in the air as described by others here  only the oxygen that leaks out of the station needs any replacement  btw  the apollo air scrubbers used lithium hydroxide cannisters  that would nt work on the iss since they d have to send lots of such cannisters up as cargo  so the iss scrubbers use an improved method that does nt need to be restocked  in the movie apollo 13 you may recall that they have problems with c02 in the air and need to use all sorts of random junk to build a make  shift c02 scrubber  maintaining the ratio of c02 to 02 in the air in a closed system is nt anything new ,0

honestly  because they discovered they can profit from it and no one can stop them  they can monetize from it  pure and simple  i m a capitalist at heart  and i m not usually the first to argue that  oh corporations are abusing their power  and whatnot  but this is a clear cut example of exactly that happening  and it s a shameful thing  isps will give you all the lines they can about  it s to make sure everyone gets enough bandwidth  and they ll say  it s to prevent people from clogging up the connection   but cm on now  our internet infrastructure is  excellent  and growing  and has been handling an ever increasing volume of traffic without problem  the   only   reason you are being capped and charged for  using too much internet  is because they can nickle and dime you  and get away with it  because they are the only provider of the service  it s a  monopoly  via size  the barrier to entry for a startup isp is so high that they d have to buy bandwidth from a higher tier carrier  who would undoubtedly also impose bandwidth fees  honestly  i think a huge anti  trust suit needs to happen  because this is the most clear example of anti  competitive behavior in the last century  and by doing nothing people are indicating to these companies that it s alright  which it s not  yes  bandwidth costs money  but that 40month each customer normally pays to their isp  more  than covers any infrastructure cost they d be able to incur on their paltry 15mb  s connection  also  the same thing goes for at  t  verizon re  text messaging  really  it does  not  cost them anything  near  25 cents to send a text message  actually  it costs them more like 0 cents    and mobile data rates    reason a   overselling capacity    imagine you re a fruit farmer  and you can provide 5000 fruits a week  you take on 100 customers who on average eat 20 fruits a week each  so you re getting through just 2000 fruits a week  now you ve got lots of spare fruit  but you re having a hard time selling it all  since most people just eat 20 fruit a week you start selling  unlimited  fruit and letting people have as much as they want  and since on average people only take 20 a week you have plenty  so people see your generous offer  and start signing up to get lots of fruit  and while most people take around 20 fruit per week  a small number of people go nuts and take 200 fruit in a single week  when you ve still got spare fruit  you let them have 200 fruit a week since it s got to go somewhere  but as you get more customers  you start struggling to make sure people get their 20 fruit  week while others are taking 200  so you find out which customers are taking more than average and  cap  them  restricting how many they can take each week to ensure everyone else can have some  the people eating 200 fruit cry out  but you said it was unlimited   and the farmer says  yes  but i did nt think you d take  that  much    so he tells them to either cut back on the amount of fruit they take  or pay more  tldr  the farmer promised something he could nt deliver as a way to attract customers    reason b  ripping people off   another farmer sees what the first farmer did  and decides to try it himself  only he has a much bigger farm that can make a lot more fruit  while he could easily cope with people taking 200 fruit every week  he does nt let people and  caps  them at about 30 fruit a week  saying that  most people only take 20 fruit per week  to make it seem fair  so anyone that wants more has to pay more for the privilege  even though this bigger farmer has the capacity to cope with it  the internet is made of a lot of autonomous nets and every provider has to pay other providers if they use parts of their network  so if one provider caps the internet for his customers even though there are no structure  problems  as there are no   then he does nt have to pay as much to the others and makes sure the money from his customers stays with him  rather than going to the others  so it s just the greed of the provider that drives this decision ,0

the best bet is actually the opposite of what you describe  it s not a lump of blood  it s a very tense muscle  so tense that there s a lack of circulation in the area  ie less blood   but it s unclear if muscle knots even exist in the first place or what exactly causes them  url0 i took a massage class in college  the instructor said a knot is really scar tissue making muscle  skin andor bone stick together  hence when you have them worked on it sounds a bit like velcro because you are tearing old scar tissue  to clear it up  you need to regularly work that same area and make sure you get some physical therapy to ensure you strengthen that muscle group so as not to get a new injury   this video   url0  has a really good explanation  basically  no one really knows  but they do exist and can be seen on special imaging ,0

the idea is they were trying to estimate the total number of tanks by looking at tank serial numbers  here s what we know  the germans are making a crap load of tanks  each tank is given a serial number  serial numbers work such that the first thing you build gets serial number 1  the next thing gets 2  then 3  the numbers are   serial    or come in a series  let s say we find a tank with serial number 77  that means the germans must have made  at least  77 tanks  however  it s probably not the case that the germans made exactly 77 tanks and we happen to have found the last tank they made  following this line of reasoning  you can start to make guesses about how many tanks there are  let s say there are 100 tanks total  if there are 100 tanks  and we select 10 tanks at random  it is guaranteed that all 10 tanks will have serial numbers less than or equal to 100  let s say there are 1000 tanks total  if we select 10 tanks at random  it s very unlikely that all 10 tanks will have serial number less than or equal to 100  with a little math  you can figure out the exact probability  so  if we ve captured 50 tanks  and the highest serial number we ve seen is 345  we know there are more than 345 tanks  but probably no where near 10000 tanks  the more tanks you find  the better you can nail down the correct value  phew  let s try it this way  you ve a hat with a random number of notes in it  each note has a certain number  you re pulling out 10 of those notes  the numbers on those might be this  1712418242830214 now the only numbers that are of interest are   how many notes did you pull out  a  10  what was the highest number  a  30 now using this nifty little formula you can make a pretty good assumption of just how many notes there are   number of notes  30   3010  1  and therefor   number of notes  32 this is nt perfectly accurate but it has been proven to be much much more effective than any other kind of intel at that time  btw  this formula is still used heavily in economics for sales statistics oh  this is not actually difficult to understand  let s say you have a bunch of tanks that are numbered  tank 1  tank 2  tank 3  all the way up to  say  tank 100  so that there are 100 tanks in total  all of these tanks have their number painted on the side  if you go into a battle and you see three tanks  tank 4  tank 82  and tank 15 is there  any way  for you to  guess  how many tanks there are in total  the answer is yes  there is a special mathematical way for you to see these three tanks and guess how many tanks there might be in total  this is how you do it  and keep in mind that  total  here is a guess only  the more tanks you see the more accurate your guess will be   total  m  1   m  k  m  largest painted number you see  for my example this number is  82   k  the total number of tanks you see  for my example this number is  3   so  total  82  1   823  total  108  which is pretty close to 100  so in this example i would conclude that germany had built roughly 108 tanks  which they then labelled 1 to 100 ,0

there s a sticky thread dealing with this type of question   url0  over in r  anarchy101  it s sort of an eli5 for anarchy questions  that you might find useful  well for one  under an anarcho  communist society  more accurately   there should be economic equality  meaning the causes of a significant amount of crime  which are poverty  related  would go away  and thus a significant amount of crime would go away  also  since drug prohibition would disappear  there would no longer be an illegal black market for drugs  which is a major cause of violent crime worldwide  with gangs and cartels fighting for territory  fighting against law enforcement  and killing civilians who get in the way or see something they were nt supposed to see  and finally  with true gender equality  it s predicted that a significant amount of sexual assault and domestic violence would disappear too  so already  an anarchist society has abolished many of the root causes of crime  then you have the ideas people have of so  called  restorative justice  which involve bringing the community together to discuss the perpetrator s wrongs  asking them to explain themselves  make amends  and then ask forgiveness from the people they wronged  if a person is a repeat  offender and refuses to change their behavior or apologize for what they ve done  a sort  of de facto exile would happen when the community voluntarily disassociates from that person  it does nt  that s why they do nt exist for more than a few days ,0

dividendyielding stocks can be a good investment for some people but there are also some risks to consider here are a few potential risks to keep in mindthe dividend may be cut or eliminated companies can choose to reduce or eliminate their dividends if they are experiencing financial difficulties or want to use their cash for other purposes if a company cuts its dividend the value of the stock may decline as a resultthe company may be less stable dividendpaying stocks are often considered to be more stable than nondividend paying stocks but this is not always the case some companies that pay dividends may be in declining industries or have other financial challenges that make them less stableinterest rate risk when interest rates rise the value of dividendpaying stocks may decline because investors may prefer to put their money into higheryielding investments like bondsmarket risk as with any stock dividendyielding stocks are subject to market risk if the market declines the value of these stocks may also declineoverall its important to carefully consider the risks of any investment including dividendyielding stocks and to diversify your portfolio to spread out your risk,1
all three of the major us market indexes you mentioned  the dow jones industrial average djia or dow the sp 500 and the nasdaq composite  include reinvested dividends in their calculationsthe dow sp 500 and nasdaq are all priceweighted indexes which means that the value of the index is determined by the prices of the individual stocks in the index rather than their market capitalization the total value of a companys outstanding shares of stock in order to accurately reflect the performance of the stocks in the index the index calculations take into account any dividends that are paid by the companies as well as any changes in the stock pricewhen a company pays a dividend it distributes a portion of its profits to its shareholders if an investor holds a stock that pays dividends they have the option to receive the dividend in cash or to have it reinvested in additional shares of the stock if an investor chooses to have the dividends reinvested the additional shares are purchased using the dividend payment and the value of the investors holdings in the stock increases as a resultwhen an index includes reinvested dividends it takes into account the additional shares that were purchased with the dividends as well as any changes in the stock price in its calculations this means that the value of the index reflects not only the changes in the stock prices but also the impact of the dividends on the overall value of the investments,1

daylight saving time is a system that adjusts the official time by moving the clock ahead by one hour for a certain period of time during the year this is usually done in the summer to make the evenings feel longer and to save energy by using less artificial lightrnrnon the days when daylight saving time starts or ends the clock will either move forward or backward by one hour at 200 am this means that if you are working an overnight shift that starts at 1100 pm and ends at 700 am your shift will actually be one hour shorter or longer depending on which way the clock is movingrnrnfor example if the clock moves forward by one hour your shift will start at 1100 pm and end at 600 am even though it will feel like you worked from 1100 pm to 700 am if the clock moves backward by one hour your shift will start at 1100 pm and end at 800 am even though it will feel like you worked from 1100 pm to 700 amrnrnso the important thing to remember is that when daylight saving time starts or ends the clock will move by one hour and this will affect the length of your overnight shift,1

by the strict definitions of those words  they were state capitalists  the means of production were owned by the state  not the workers so that rules out socialism and distribution did not occur from the workers to those who needed it so that rules out communism  however this only muddies the reality of the situations which were in fact deeply complex and can not be summed up with a simple label  this might be a good question for r  communism101 and r  debatecommunism  ca nt answer the first  but i can answer the second  lets get one thing out of the way though  it is not an economic system that people blame  it is an entire ideology  remember  communism  or maosim  or any derivative there of  stretches beyond economics and politics  it controls religion  foreign policy  welfare  and everything down to basic allowances  now that we have that out of the way  the reason people blame communism  maoism and not the leaders who controlled the nations is that both countries were prime examples of radically changing nations that opposed the western world in both ideology and political power  they did nt help their case by being rather violent and oppressive towards their own people  which bothered the sensibilities of the west   as well as being very outspoken  both engaged in some sort of warfare  clandestine  via proxy  or all out combat  agasint the us and it s allies  another interesting point is that the west typically attributes major tragedies caused by governments with revolution  which in turn wipes the mental slate clean for observing nations  for an example  see essentially every european nation   the russian and chinese governments you mention both have extremely large death tolls shortly after their creation  themselves being children of violent revolutions which overthrew semi  western friendly nations   and were nt overthrew  this seemed to have caused a stagnation in opinion from the west  that coupled with my previous points makes for a pretty good reason  in my opinion  on why one would attribute such things with communism ,0
game programmers use odd percentages to determine damage or other outcomes in games because it allows them to have more precise control over the balance of the game for example if a spell or weapon in a game does additional damage equal to 2668 of the spell or weapon damage it allows the game designers to finetune the balance of that spell or weapon to be slightly stronger or weaker than if the percentage were a round number like 27 or 26 using more precise numbers like 2668 also allows game designers to make small adjustments to the balance of the game without making larger more noticeable changes this can be important because even small changes to the balance of a game can have a big impact on how the game is played and using more precise percentages allows game designers to make those changes in a more subtle and controlled way its also worth noting that computers are very good at working with precise numbers so using more precise percentages can make it easier for the games code to execute the calculations needed to determine the damage or other outcomes in the game,1

why does a language which was once the dominant primary language stop being that way  the short answer is political  economic  and cultural power  when the roman empire ruled the entire mediterranean basin  using latin as the language of politics  law  and trade  anyone who wanted to interact with the roman government or roman citizens needed to speak latin  but as the influence of the empire gradually receded  latin went with it  being gradually replaced by the languages of the peoples that assumed power in rome s place  latin was maintained as the language of scholarship well into the eighteenth century  but as the introduction of the printing press improved literacy amongst the common people  who did nt speak latin   the demand for materials in local languages ensured its practical demise by 1900 or so  even the vatican is moving away from it  by contrast  native languages are almost never really languages of power  as soon as indigenous peoples come into contact with a dominant imperial  colonial nation  the power imbalance is such that there is incredible pressure on the natives to speak the imperial language and almost no incentive for the imperials to learn the native language  that kind of pressure is why languages die  it s not just straight imperial avarice though  languages used for trade and law benefit in terms of their functionality and vocabulary  this is one of the main reasons english is becoming so influential  it s got a word for almost everything  and if it does nt  it ll borrow one  so it s not just that imperial languages are imperial  but you can also use them to say things that you might not have been able to say in a native language  latin lives on  but not as a spoken language and not as a native tongue  latin  in its day  was divided into two forms   classical latin  and  vulgar  latin  classical latin was the language of elites  of the writers and of the readers  at the time of the roman empire a very small group of people  it is the clasical latin that died out in common use and that lives on in medicine and prep schools and science etc  the  vulgar latin  did live on it just evolved  into the romance languages  it did nt really die out  it s seen continued use in science  as well as morphing into the romance languages  such as spanish  it s considered a dead language because there are nt any native speakers anymore  which happened when rome was repeatedly sacked and the citizens that formerly spoke latin natively were killed or integrated into the country that now contained them  and took on that language  same for small  local languages ,0
human skin color is determined by the amount of pigment called melanin that is produced by cells in the skin people who live in areas of the world that receive a lot of sunlight such as africa tend to have more melanin in their skin to protect them from the suns harmful ultraviolet uv rays on the other hand people who live in areas with less sunlight such as europe tend to have less melanin in their skin this is because less melanin is needed to protect their skin from the suns uv raysrnrnover time people who lived in europe evolved to have less melanin in their skin because it was advantageous for their bodies to produce less of the pigment this is because less melanin meant that their skin absorbed more uv light which their bodies used to produce vitamin d vitamin d is important for maintaining strong bones and a healthy immune systemrnrnso to sum it up europeans became lightskinned because their ancestors lived in an area with less sunlight and their bodies evolved to produce less melanin in order to make it easier for them to produce vitamin d,1

i can do the math and understand that this is the case  but i simply can not wrap my head around this  the shape with the smallest perimeter  to  area ratio is the circle  it s not possible to cram more space in a smaller perimeter  thus the closer a shape is to being a circle  the more area it covers for the same perimeter  a square is closer to being a circle than a rectangle is  and thus a square of a given perimeter will cover a larger area than a rectangle of the same perimeter  imagine a rope with a length of 100 cm  which is the perimeter of your shapes   set that rope out so that it forms a square with 25 cm sides  now  take two opposite corners of that square  and pull them apart from each other so you get a diamond shape  keep pulling until the corners are 50 cm apart from each other  as you pull  you gradually reduce the area of the shape  so that eventually it reaches zero  you end up with two lines  each 50 cm long  each made up from what used to be two sides of the square  lying next to each other with no area in between them  you should hopefully be able to see from this that the area of a shape can vary quite a lot even if the perimeter remains constant  look at the proportional change in the individual dimensions  your first dimension goes from 20 to 25  this is a 25  increase  your second dimension decreases from 30 to 25  this is a 167  decrease  while the perimeter is the same the area has changed be cause the scale has changed ,0
i recently learned how people get surnames in iceland which is pretty interesting  daughters get their surname after their mother s first name and dottir is added to it  meaning daughter in icelandic  and sons get their surname after their father s first name  son  eg if your name is bill and you get a son then his surname will be billsson in iceland which literally means bill s son  so in iceland a woman s surname does not change after marriage  edit  i could ve gotten some facts wrong so if someone knows how things really are then please correct me  there s also a wiki link that explains icelandic names  first of all  many do  if they do nt  it is simply an old tradition that makes it easier for the entire family to have one name  currently  with families mixing and women establishing their own credit and professional reputations prior to marriage  many do not change their name  personally  i have been married twice but kept my first husband s name so they matched the children  traditionally  a woman would leave the house of her own family and join her husband s family when she got married  back then  a surname was nt just a second name either  it was often linked to an extended family  tribe  or homeland  for example  a smith  baker  or miller would have actually had those occupations in the family for generations  so it would make sense that anyone joining the family  including a woman marrying in  would change her name  the same would go if she was moving to a different town or joining a tribe who the family had the name of ,0
most lifetime supply things i ve seen they ll take a national average of a certain product and let you have that  i remember a lifetime supply of pizza but really it was like 50 pizzas a year  probably there to prevent abuse of the system  well  if you won say a lifetime supply of snickers  you d probably sign a contract entitling you to 300 snickers a year for 50 years  my guess would be that it s mainly based on publicity potential  if they re too stingy it could cause them a black eye  so they ll be pretty generous  without leaving the limit so high as to represent an unacceptable expense  that said  you should realize that in most contests the prize itself is far from being the biggest expense involved  for a big contest  advertising and publicity can cost twenty times the prize  and administration of entries and suchlike can cost a few times the prize  it is nt really worth their while to spend lots of time trying to research exactly how big the prize should be  ie let s do lots of work to find out just how much gas an average family of four uses in a year  if for no other reason than because the money spent doing that research would better be spent making the prize itself bigger  so that it s better publicity ,0

much of the value of a work of art is based on being unique and significant  what looks like a solid color to you was painted by a specific artist at a particular time and place in history  that artist had a reputation and views of what art means  that painting was then viewed by people  potentially famous ones that spoke or wrote about it and other artists were inspired or influenced by it  some of these works may have been controversial or scandalous when they came out because nobody else had quite done the same thing  these tiny pictures may not fully show intricate details and painting technique  buying a baseball because it was somebody s 300th home run is also pretty ridiculous unless you re a baseball fan  and  ultimately  some people just have too much fucking money  buying expensive things to show people they can afford to waste money on frivolous things is a hobby  artwork is nt a commodity in the traditional sense  it s a cultural object  much of it s value lies in it s ability to  speak  rather than just existing as an object  many artworks in conceptual or postmodernist veins are opaque because they are dialoguing about art  you have to have an existing investment in understanding art before the works become compelling for you  a second thing to keep in mind is that these works do nt thrive when photographed  gerhardt richter s mirrors do amazing things to spaces when you re in the same room as them  also  they tend to be fairly massive  barnett newman s paintings tend to be quite large as well  like cy twombly and jackson pollock  his work is meant to be viewed from very close  the intensity of the pigments he uses along with the large flat plains of colors make the mechanism of seeing self evident  you ca nt help but notice that your eyes in your head add all sorts of crazy things to your vision  often times  like with ellsworth kelly and mark rothko   there is a tremendous amount of effort in creating an exact texture to the surface to give the work a certain presence in the space  these pieces appear simple because most of the information placed in them is lost in the conversion to a digital image  they take days or weeks of slowly building up layers of paint to produce a depth that is only visible in person  i ve said it before but it bears repeating  art is an academic pursuit  it seems to be the only academic pursuit where the laypeople assume they re just as informed as the people that are educated  these prices are obscene but you re making assumptions about how simple they actually are  many of these artists spend much of their time writing and creating theories of aesthetics  culture and phenomenology  these are exercises of their theories and i can assure that none of these pieces were thought up and executed in  minutes   the art market is pretty insane right now  i do nt want to misrepresent anything by saying it s not a dick measuring contest between people with too much money on hand  the artists  most of these guys are dead  do nt actually get any money from secondary market sales like these  auction houses invest a great deal into getting these works into the hands of collectors  hundreds of people are employed at a place like christie s or sotheby s  they have art restorers  art handlers  auctioneers  academics  researchers  appraisers  photographers  graphic designers  and basically anything else that comes up in running a large corporation  the expenses can be huge  to cover all of this in a 10  15  commission the prices have to be incredibly high  edit  one other thing i forgot to mention is that the art market provides a great way for the extremely wealthy to diversify their wealth  not only do they get incredible tax breaks for loaning the pieces to museums  the art market tends to fluctuate independently of the stock market  rises in income inequality tend to tank the stock market while bolstering the art market  at the billionaire level of wealth it d be stupid not to have a great art collection  tl  dr the prices are obscene but these works are nt as simple as they appear  contemporary art of this caliber has theoretical underpinnings that one should understand before they dismiss the work  source  i m an artist  art handler and my girlfriend works at an auction house  because of the painter  also  to be fair  the time it takes to finish it does nt necessarily correlate with how expensive it should be or its artistic value ,0

an airplane flying over land that is experiencing a massive earthquake would not be directly affected by the earthquake the earthquake would occur on the ground and would not have any direct impact on the airplane which is flying in the skyrnrnhowever an earthquake of that magnitude could have indirect effects on an airplane for example the earthquake could damage infrastructure on the ground such as airports roads and communication systems this could make it difficult for the airplane to land or take off or for air traffic controllers to communicate with the airplanernrnadditionally earthquakes can sometimes cause other natural disasters such as landslides tsunamis or volcanic eruptions these disasters could also potentially affect an airplane depending on where they occurrnrnso while the earthquake itself would not directly affect the airplane there could be indirect effects on the airplane as a result of the earthquake,1
in those places where it used to be an every day sort of drink  it largely still is  go to france  italy  etc  and you ll find that it s served everywhere and commonly had with meals as it always was  those places where it has assumed a certain air of sophistication tend to be those places that were nt traditionally wine drinking regions in the first place  such as the us or canada  one reason has been covered  in countries where wine is not historically prevalent  it is an exotic import and therefore expensive and sophisticated  also worth noting is that in countries where wine is prevalent  it flows like water  my one speculation is this  during the  age of france   17  19 centuries  when france was the dominant power in the world  the nobles in other countries adopted french customs  one of those customs is drinking wine  and as with any adoption of a foreign custom by rich locals  that wine has to be  the best that even the french would envy   you see this nowadays  with  say  rich people from third world countries  i use the term loosely and incorrectly  only being impressed with harvard or oxbridge although the us and the uk have other excellent schools  so  anyway  when the rich import something that is so prohibitively expensive that it is only available to them  of course it becomes something associated with class and sophistication  this is especially true in societies where wine was not commonly drunk before  wine has  always  been a slightly more upscale drink than the alternatives  for most of human history  it was beer and its affiliates that the common rabble drank  wine is a bit harder to make than beer  you need decent grapes  grown properly  or similar decent  quality ingredients  such as honey for mead  and it typically needs to age longer  which is expensive ,0

kilograms and pounds are units of measurement used to describe the mass of an object mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object and it is the same no matter where you are in the universe weight on the other hand is a measure of the force exerted on an object due to gravity the weight of an object depends on its mass and the strength of the gravitational field it is inheres an example to help illustrate the difference between mass and weight imagine you have a bag of potatoes that weighs 10 pounds on earth if you took that same bag of potatoes to the moon which has a weaker gravitational field than earth the bag of potatoes would weigh less than 10 pounds because the force of gravity on the moon is weaker than it is on earth however the mass of the bag of potatoes would still be the same regardless of whether it is on earth or the moonso to summarize kilograms and pounds are both used to measure mass but weight is a measure of the force exerted on an object due to gravity and depends on the mass of the object and the strength of the gravitational field it is in,1
the holy trinity is a concept in christianity that refers to the belief that there is one god who exists as three persons the father the son jesus christ and the holy spirit the idea of the holy trinity is meant to help people understand the nature of god it is meant to show that god is one being but that he exists in three distinct persons the father is seen as the creator of the universe the son jesus is seen as the savior of humanity and the holy spirit is seen as the presence of god that is active in the world today even though the concept of the holy trinity includes three persons christianity is still considered a monotheistic religion this is because all three persons of the holy trinity are believed to be one being with the same divine nature and attributes so even though the holy trinity includes three persons it is still believed that there is only one god this can be difficult to understand but many christians believe that the concept of the holy trinity helps them to better understand and experience the presence and nature of god in their lives,1
part of it is also tied to the price of oil extraction  alberta for instance has been experiencing an economic boom because of the oil sands  however when the market value of petrol drops below whatever it costs to extract and process oil from those oil sandsiirc  75 a barrel around 2000   it becomes a better strategy for the owners of the oil sands to stop extracting oil until the price comes back up  some countries  or states  have their economies based on oil income  having the price drop is like having their paycheck drop  you are asking why lower prices would be bad  in general i can not see why lower prices are bad  i agree with your whole money multiplier argument  that if people have to spend less on fuel  they have more to spend elsewhere  and that can lead to a virtuous cycle of growth  of course the money multiplier effect has its limits  it suffers the  broken window fallacy   for example  if unemployment benefits are so good for the economy  then we should all quit work and go on unemployment  and natural disasters like katrina and sandy are not a net positive for the economy even though spending goes up  one should take care in applying the money multiplier argument  printing money does not create prosperity  prosperity comes of productive effort  but i think you might be interested in this question  could lower oil prices signal economic deterioration  they most certainly could  and if lower oil prices can signal weakness  then what contributing factors would lead to same  1  declining demand stemming from global growth slow down  2  no change in supply  a classic leveraged inventory build  inventory built on debt  debt secured on inventory priced at  100  bbl oil  oil now selling at near half that  producers can no longer cover costs  debt becomes toxic  and a whole systemic unwind  contagion  begins in global debt markets  call it the money  divider  effect  where money is destroyed as debts go unpaid  tldr search and replace the word oil in above paragraph with the word homes  and tell me why this time is different ,0
im sorry but im not aware of any current war on contraceptives taking place contraceptives also known as birth control are methods or devices used to prevent pregnancy they are a common and widely used form of healthcare and there is generally not a significant political or social conflict surrounding their availability or use there may be debates or discussions about certain types of contraceptives and whether or not they should be covered by insurance or provided by certain organizations but these debates are typically not framed as a war and are instead part of a larger conversation about healthcare policies and access to reproductive healthcare if you have any specific questions about contraceptives or reproductive healthcare i would be happy to try to help,1
so back in the day a dollar was a silver certificate that you could exchange for a dollar worth of silver  coins used to be made mostly of silver  so a quarter had 25â¢ worth of silver and a dime 10â¢ there used to be a half dime  but it was deemed to impractical because of how small it was  so the nickel came out in a larger size made with cheaper metal   three of them have numbers describing their values    url0  one cent  five cents  and quarter dollar  the only one that does nt fit that is the dime  which describes itself as one dime  they are different sized  thicknesses  and have their names on them  there is no need for numbers  as to the sizes of the coins  that has to do with the time that they were actually made of precious metals  that a penny was 1 cent worth of copper  a nickle was 5 cents worth of nickle  a dime was 10 cents worth of silver  a quarter was 25 cents worth of silver  etc ,0

lactose intolerance is essentially a severe deficiency in the enzyme lactase  which breaks lactose down into digestible sugars  lactose  in case you were nt aware  is a type of sugar   humans at some point started drinking milk well past infancy  and eventually evolved the ability to continue expressing lactase throughout their lives  most other mammals stop producing lactase once they have ceased to feed from their mother s milk   however  there still remain some people who do not continue to express lactase  especially those people for whom domestication and farming were historically absent   as a result  they do not digest lactose  and it continues in its normal form through the digestive system  as it passes through your intestines  it essentially works to draw water out of your system and through your digestive tract  resulting in watery stool  diarrhea   someone who drinks a significant amount of lactose while lactose intolerant will have symptoms similar to those of someone who overdoses on laxatives  intense diarrhea  stomach cramps  and bloating  two part answer  if they chug as much as they can the same things that happen to a  lactose tolerant  person who does that as lactose intolerance is usually a threshold thing with reduced ability to digest it rather than absolutely no ability  lactose is two simple sugar molecules joined together  a glucose and a galactose  the lactase enzyme normally breaks the bond between the two and the simple sugars can then be absorbed from the small intestine  when someone drinks more lactose than their body can produce lactase to digest then the unbroken lactose persists further along the digestive tract until it is eventually fermented by bacteria which causes an excess of gas and discomfort  the lactose and fermentation products can also cause water to be drawn into the bowels leading to diarrhea  the discomfort can lead to nausea and vomiting  they might puke  they might get explosive diarrhea accompaniment by gas that could kill a man and a stomach that sounds like to dinosaurs battling each other  source  non compliant florida man with lactose intolerance ,0
hey  ph  d here working on light induced degradation  lid  in solar cells  essentially  you need to think of the efficiency of a solar cell as its ability to generate but also collect electrons as useful energy  now in the body of the solar cell  which we call the bulk  you can get many things that will steal that electron and stop it from being collected  these include metallic impurities  iron  chromium  copper  etc    crystallographic defects and usually anything that has a charge that can capture an electron or a hole  which we call charge carriers   the more of these defects you have the lower your effective efficiency  so what happens out in the field over time  there are many things that can happen that can cause a module to degrade  on the macro level  standard deterioration from corrosion  uv exposure  humidity  etc as mentioned by others in this thread  we also have a few such as pid  potential induced degradation  and lid  light induced degradation   lid for example in monocrystalline solar cells is largely known to be due to the boron  oxygen defects  under sunlight  boron and oxygen can combine together to form a b  o complex  which likes to steal charge carriers and usually results in a drop in efficiency within the first 48 hours  now this problem has largely been solved  there are a few other known elements that can cause degradation under sunlight  ie copper  which can form precipitates  and hydrogen  etc etc  but it is exposed to elements  ie sun  humidity  wind  temperature changes  etc  is not that there s a single point of failure  according to a  2012 study   url1  by the nrel  national renewable energy laboratory  in the us some of the causes are   constant temperature changes  night  day thermal cycling  makes some soldering  weak  so cables and circuitry may get disconnected or with a higher electrical resistance   damp heat  may cause corrosion on cells   sun rays  uv light  causes the color of the cell to fade  which is important because of the way panels work to generate transform energy  and to this add   cheaper materials  manifacturers cutting corners  using less material to make them    bad  transportation and installation  with less material  they re more fragile and handle less stress  as you can see there are multiple reasons for degradation even without moving parts  still they have a lifetime around 25  30 years but every year they degrade around 05  to 3    source   url0  i m not smart or anything but i know that perpetual motion machines are impossible due to the laws of thermodynamics so solar panels will eventually lose its efficiency,0
a deductible is the amount you have to pay before your insurance pays anything  i ll give you some examples   1  imagine you own a car  you have insurance to protect yourself from someone hitting you with their car  you have a  5000 deductible  someone hits your car  they cause  4000 worth of damage  because your deductible is  5000  and  4000 is less than  5000  you pay the entire cost to fix your car and your insurance pays  0  however  let s say someone hits your car and causes  15000 worth of damage  you pay the  first   5000  this is your deductible  and the insurance pays the  second   10000   2  say you have insurance to cover the cost of prescriptions  your annual deductible is  2000  so you go to the doctor and he tells you that you need to buy some medicine  the cost for the medicine is  500  because  500 is less than  2000 you pay the entire  500 and your insurance pays  0  but imagine if he tells you that the medicine costs  10000  then you pay the  first   2000 and your insurance pays the  second   8000   the idea behind the deductible is twofold  1  insurance companies  like all companies  exist to make a profit and that means paying as little as possible  and 2  if you have to spend your own money then you re less likely to waste it than if you feel like you re spending  free  money  i m glad to see this question in eli5  i have a secondary follow up question  statement  is the premium inversely proportional to the deductible  ex   related to agentpissant s example  if my car insurance deductible is  5000 my intuition is that i m paying a really cheap monthly premium   20  month  let s say   however  what if i suddenly graduate college and can afford better insurance  if i now can afford  100  month insurance  i  hopefully  should have a lower deductible  say  3000  is this example correct  how do insurance companies figure this out  overall  the insurance company is in the win  i ve been in one small accident the 10  years i ve been driving and paid a monthly premium each month  it s kinda bullshit but that s what the safety of insurance is  the deductible is the amount you have to pay out of pocket before the insurance company will cover the rest  example  if you have car insurance with a  500 deductible  and you get into an accident that causes  2000 of damage to the car  you pay  500  the insurance company pays the other  1500 ,0

what you need to understand is that  time  and  space  are not separate things  they exist in one 4 dimensional space called  spacetime  in spacetime  everything is always moving at  the speed of light  through the 4 dimensional space  usually  this is almost fully expressed in the  time  dimension  as your speed increases as movement through the 3  space  dimensions  your speed in the  time  dimension must decrease  since the vector sum of all 4 dimensions must always be a vector with speed  c   in other words  the faster you move through space  the slower you move through time  if you move at the speed of light  this means your movement in through spacetime lies fully in the 3 space dimensions  the vector length in the  time  dimension is 0  thus  if you travel at the speed of light through space  time stands still for you  i do nt know that it s accurate to say  time stops   there is no perspective of time for an object moving at the speed of light  if you do the math we have now  you wind up with an equation that is undefined at c imagine an old analog clock ticking forward  measuring time  now get in a ship and fly away from that clock at the speed of light  if you and the light leaving the clock s hand are moving at the same speed  the movement of the clock would appear to freeze  move faster than the speed of light and the hands would appear to tick backwards ,0

i m not up on the exact biochemistry  it s been almost 15 years since i took high school bio   but basically you start out with a fat  carbohydrate or protein molecule  which are big chains of carbon  hydrogen and oxygen atoms with a lot of energy in their chemical bonds  the body has various chemical processes for breaking those bonds  the energy that is released is used to attach phosphate groups to amp and adp  adenosine monophosphate and adenosine diphosphate  to turn them into atp  adenosine triphosphate   which is fuel that the cells use for energy  which itself releases energy into the cell by breaking off phosphate groups and reverting back to amp and adp  the food molecules are continuously broken down until they become carbon dioxide and water  which you release from your body when you breathe  not sure how detailed you want it  because the details are complex biochemical processes and may not make much sense if you do nt have any chemistry knowledge  essentially  carbohydrates  fats and protein are converted to their single units  monomers   and then small biochemical changes are made to these monomers which generate atp  a form of stored energy in the body   three basic processes make up the generation of atp in cellular respiration  glycolysis  the krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation  which requires oxygen   the type of food consumed determines where this chain of events starts  glucose for example undergoes glycolysis resulting in the generation of 2 molecules of pyruvate  which then enters the krebs cycle  in prescence of oxygen  then undergoes oxidative phosphorylation  fatty acids enter the krebs cycle directly  as does protein  in the form of deaminated amino acids  albeit at a different step of the krebs cycle  the main atp producing stage is oxidative phosphorylation  although glycolysis and the krebs cycle do produce atp as well   during the krebs cycle a lot of reduced nad is generated  and this is used during oxidative phos  during oxidative phosphorylation  electrons are transferred from electron donors  reduced nad  to electron acceptors such as oxygen  in redox reactions  these redox reactions release energy  which is used to form atp from a molecule of adp and organic phosphate  atp contains a high energy bond  and contains 3 phosphate groups  when this bond is broken to form adp  2 phosphate groups   energy is released and this energy can then be utilised as required  the others explained very well but i ll try to make it a little more eli5  from the moment you put food in your mouth until the small intestine  it is continuosly broken down in smaller parts  the purpose of this is to make the bits small enough so they pass trough the very tiny  holes  in your intestine  to your bloodstream  once the food  which was broken down to a molecular level  reaches your blood  it goes trough the porta vein  the vein that goes from your intestine to your liver  to the liver  once it gets to the liver  the body has to decide what to do with it  this is usually controlled trough hormones like insulin  some of it goes back in your blood  some of it is stocked and some of it is processed in the liver into more complex molecules  now you have food  like glucose  the simplest form of sugar   broken down into tiny bits in your blood  blood goes to your cells and trough a fairly complex mechanism  i dont understand it well enough to explain it easily  the cell opens up to accept the glucose  the glucose is now in your cell  the cell  trough some complex mechanisms like the citric cycle  breaks down the sugar and the energy released is moved with the help of atp to where it is needed ,0
i ca nt explain it better than this website with animations  url0 the needle can move in two dimensions that are 90 â° apart so that they do nt interfere with each other  one channel of sound is encoded in how far  north and south  the groove is  and the other is in how far  east and west  it is  in principle  you could make one of the dimensions  n and s  up and down into the vinyl  and the other one  e and w  left and right along the groove at the same depth  so  one way to encode two channels of sound would be to have sound for the left speaker dig into the vinyl at different depths  and the other side move the needle left and right  when the machine reads the record later  it knows where the needle is in both of the two dimensions at each point in time  so it can play two independent channels  the directions here are at a 45 â° angle instead because it turns out horizontal and vertical grooves behave differently  so one dimension goes from  up  left  to  down  right   and the other dimension goes from  up  right  to  down  left   the needle is connected to two  pistons  basically  that are set 90 â° from each other  45 each from the surface   this is a summary of the graphical explanation in the top comment for those who want text instead of links to other sites  i d like to know this too  can we have an eli5 answer rather than links to other sites  kinda what we come here for ,0
humans are always producing heat  at temperatures above 986 the body has a harder time releasing the heat that it produces  temperatures 70 degrees feel the most comfortable because it s the easiest for the body to maintain 986 degrees internally  986 is only the internal temperature  as you may know  the further from a heat source you are  the cooler it is  so  your skin ends up being less than 986 degrees  since our sense of warmth is based on heat flow  if heat is flowing into our skin via the air  because the air is hotter than out 90 degree skin   it will feel too warm  jesus christ  your blood is about to boil  go see a doctor ,0

i used to deal craps  it s good money  here is a basic understanding    1    a game is about to start    2    you put money on the pass line    3    the first dice is rolled    three things can happen     you can win  roll a 7  11   lose  2312  or the game can start  any other dice combo  4568910     4    in the event that you do nt auto win or auto lose the game starts  lets use a  6  as an example  you rolled a 6  so the game starts  the big button is placed on the six and it will read  on    5    now the rules change a bit   only  one number can hurt you and it s a 7  every other number can be a winner in some way  especially the 6    6    7 is the most common number that can be rolled  in the event that a 7 is rolled again all the money gets wiped off the table  in the event that your number is rolled again  the 6   everybody wins   you are basically saying this phrase when you play craps  i bet i can roll a number  and i bet i can re  roll that same number  before a 7  which is the most common number  is rolled     7    now the fun comes in with all the numbers in between  lets focus on those big box numbers  4568910  lets assume that you ve rolled a 6  the button is  on  the 6  the game has been established  your ultimate goal is to roll a 6 again before you roll a 7  however  you can put money on the 4589   10  in the event that those numbers come up during a roll    you win    in the event that those numbers do not come up    you dont lose    that is why people have so much fun with craps  you can throw a bet up on the  8   as the game is going  if an 8 comes up  you get paid  if a 234591011  or 12 is rolled you do nt lose your money  but every time the 8 is rolled you re going to get paid  you can put money on all those numbers  as often as they come up you get paid  you can even  press  the bet  which means doubling your bet at any time    8    so in our fictional game being played so far  the roller originally a rolled a 6  and you have made am extra bet on an 8  every time an 8 comes up you win extra  no other number hurts you  except the 7   your sitting at the table and the roller keeps rolling a 5 as well  you say shit  i m gon na throw money up on the 5  and so now you have bets on the 5  8   do nt forget our originally the number the 6  all of these are winners    this is getting long so i will add more in a follow up comment   i ll leave it to others to explain the rules  but i will just leave this thought  stick to the pass line bets  and when a point is established  back your original bet with a large  odds  bet  this odds bet is paid at true odds  no house edge  that s the best bet you re ever going to get in a casino  all that exotic looking stuff in the middle of the table  learn them if you want  but they are sucker bets  remember that when you see people throwing chips all over the table like they re big hot shot high rollers  and do nt be intimidated  they re idiots playing some of the worst bets in the house  strongo did a really good job explaining pass  dont pass bets  and junkeee999 added a good bit about the true odds offered behind your pass line bet  craps is a game that is hard to get into because it has its own language  which is part of what players find fun about it  for a lexicon on craps terminology  i recommend  this craps glossary   url0  ,0
a tax inversion is a type of corporate restructuring in which a company changes its legal domicile or headquarters to a country with lower tax rates this allows the company to reduce its overall tax burden and increase its profitability there are several reasons why companies might consider moving their headquarters to another country one reason is that the united states has one of the highest corporate tax rates in the world the current federal corporate tax rate in the united states is 21 which is higher than the average corporate tax rate in other developed countries another reason is that the united states has a worldwide system of taxation which means that american companies are taxed on their worldwide income regardless of where it is earned this can be a disadvantage for companies that do a lot of business overseas as they may be taxed at a higher rate than their foreign competitors as for which is better  making tax inversion illegal or making us taxes more appealing for companies to stay  there are pros and cons to both approaches on one hand making tax inversion illegal could help to prevent companies from taking advantage of lower tax rates in other countries and could potentially result in more revenue for the us government however it could also discourage companies from doing business in the united states as they may feel that they are not being treated fairly on the other hand making us taxes more appealing for companies to stay could help to keep businesses in the country and potentially create more jobs however it could also result in the us government collecting less revenue as companies would be paying lower tax rates ultimately the best approach may be a combination of both the us government could consider lowering corporate tax rates and implementing measures to prevent tax inversion while also providing incentives for companies to stay in the country such as tax breaks for businesses that invest in research and development or create new jobs,1
the mechanism in play is the same one that causes the bottom to burst off of a bottle when it is filled with water and you strike the top  basically when you hit the bottle  the bottle moves down faster than the liquid  this causes a cavitation  vacuum  to form  almost as quickly as the cavitation forms  the liquid quickly and violently slams down to fill it  when the bottle is filled with water  all this energy just pops the bottom of the bottle off but when the bottle is filled with a carbonated beverage  the co2 is quickly forced out of solution  here it is in slow motion  url0 edit  this video shows the mechanism in action in both still liquids and carbonated liquids  url1 the tap on the top of the bottle causes shock waves to reverberate through the beer  this spawns bubbles  and those bubbles are broken apart further by the echoes of the original shock wave  boom  gusher  url0 well  mainly  because an asshole does it ,0
sometimes when you feel an itch it can feel like the itch is coming from under your skin and no matter how much you scratch you cant make the feeling go away this can be very frustrating one reason this might happen is because the nerves in your skin that send the itch signal to your brain are very sensitive and even if you scratch the area that itches the nerves might still be sending the itch signal to your brain another reason might be that there is something under your skin like a bug bite or a rash that is causing the itch if the itch is really bothersome and you cant make it go away by scratching you might want to talk to a doctor to see if there is anything they can do to help,1
the answer is that the fist program on a new computer design is created on another computer design  it is called cross compiling and it is like how program for mobile phones are compiled on pcs  but then is the question how is the software for the first computer created  it was done by hand and the computer was programmed by connecting electrical wires or by manualy creating punch cards  punch tape the first programs were made by flipping switches on the front of the giant computers  later programs were made by punching holes in cards and feeding them into machines  it was nt until decades after the first computer that people were able to write programs entirely on computers  at the time  shells already existed on teletype terminals  these were essentially electric typewriters hooked up to a phone line or serial cable  what you typed did nt go to a screen  but onto a paper spool  the running gag is when someone writes something followed by hhhh  the terminal output to disregard the last 4 characters  in this case  the video terminal was an experimental peripheral at the time  and someone programmed a ui for it  and they did nt even have to use a teletype terminal to do it  back then  punch cards were still very popular  and people could have written the first ui strictly in punch cards  bypassing the teletype entirely  i was nt there at xerox parc  so i do nt know if this is actually how it was done or not ,0
there are a few ways you can try to find the smallest transaction fees and commissions available and reduce trading overheadshop around look for a brokerage or exchange that charges low fees for the type of trading you want to do some brokers and exchanges charge a flat fee per trade while others charge a percentage of the trade value compare the fees and commissions of different brokers and exchanges to find the lowest onesuse limit orders when you place a limit order you specify the maximum price you are willing to pay for a security or the minimum price you are willing to accept for it limit orders are not guaranteed to be filled but they can help you save on transaction fees because you are not paying the market price for the securityuse a feefree trading platform some trading platforms offer feefree trading for certain types of assets or for a limited time these platforms make their money from other sources such as lending out the assets you hold or selling your data to third partiestrade less frequently the more trades you make the more you will pay in transaction fees consider whether you really need to make a trade or if you can wait for a better opportunityuse taxadvantaged accounts if you are investing for the long term consider using a taxadvantaged account such as an individual retirement account ira or a 401k these accounts often have lower fees and can provide tax benefitsits important to keep in mind that while reducing fees and commissions is important its also important to consider the overall quality and reliability of the brokerage or exchange you are using you dont want to compromise on these factors just to save a few dollars in fees,1
standardized tests are often machinegraded which means that a machine reads the answers and assigns a score the machine is designed to look for darkened circles on the answer sheet which is how it knows which answer the testtaker has chosenrnrnmechanical pencils use thin pieces of graphite called leads to make marks on paper these leads can break easily and if they break while youre taking a test the machine might not be able to read your answer correctly thats why most standardized tests dont allow you to use mechanical pencils instead they require you to use a pen with ink which is less likely to break and makes a darker mark that the machine can easily readrnrnso the reason you cant use mechanical pencils on standardized tests is because the machine might not be able to read your answers if you do its important to make sure that your answers are clear and easy to read so that the machine can grade your test accurately,1

quantitative easing also known as qe is a monetary policy used by central banks to stimulate economic growth by increasing the money supply and lowering interest rates it is typically used when traditional monetary policy tools such as lowering the benchmark interest rate are no longer effective in boosting economic activitythere are a few ways in which quantitative easing can negatively affect stocksinflation concerns one concern about quantitative easing is that it can lead to higher inflation as it increases the money supply and lowers the cost of borrowing this can erode the purchasing power of money which can be negative for stocksmarket distortion another concern is that quantitative easing can distort the market by artificially manipulating the price of assets such as stocks this can create a bubble in the market which can eventually lead to a crashuncertainty finally there can be uncertainty surrounding quantitative easing as it is a relatively new and unconventional policy tool this uncertainty can create volatility in the market and affect investor confidence which can negatively impact stocksits important to note that the effects of quantitative easing can vary depending on the specific circumstances of each case and are not necessarily always negative,1
there are a few reasons why computers can stop working over time one reason is that computers have parts that can wear out or break for example a computers hard drive stores all of its files and if the hard drive stops working the computer wont be able to access those files and it will stop working another reason is that computers generate heat when they are running and if they dont have a way to cool off they can become damaged finally computers can also stop working if they are not maintained properly such as if they are not kept clean or if they are not protected from power surges or other types of damage so in short computers can stop working due to physical wear and tear overheating and lack of maintenance,1
it is normal for the value of your 401k to fluctuate over time and it is possible for the value to go down in the short term this can be due to changes in the stock market or other economic factors that affect the value of the investments in your 401k however it is important to remember that 401k accounts are longterm investment vehicles and that the value of your account will likely go up and down over time it is generally advisable to remain invested in your 401k for the long term and to diversify your investments to help manage risk,1
in the philosophy of mind mindâ€“body dualism denotes either the view that mental phenomena are nonphysical or that the mind and body are distinct and separable thus it encompasses a set of views about the relationship between mind and matter as well as between subject and object and is contrasted with other positions such as physicalism and enactivism in the mindâ€“body problemnaristotle shared platos view of multiple souls and further elaborated a hierarchical arrangement corresponding to the distinctive functions of plants animals and humans a nutritive soul of growth and metabolism that all three share a perceptive soul of pain pleasure and desire that only humans and other animals share and the faculty of reason that is unique to humans only in this view a soul is the hylomorphic form of a viable organism wherein each level of the hierarchy formally supervenes upon the substance of the preceding level for aristotle the first two souls based on the body perish when the living organism dies whereas remains an immortal and perpetual intellective part of mind for plato however the soul was not dependent on the physical body he believed in metempsychosis the migration of the soul to a new physical body it has been considered a form of reductionism by some philosophers since it enables the tendency to ignore very big groups of variables by its assumed association with the mind or the body and not for its real value when it comes to explaining or predicting a studied phenomenonndualism is closely associated with the thought of renã© descartes 1641 which holds that the mind is a nonphysicalâ€”and therefore nonspatialâ€”substance descartes clearly identified the mind with consciousness and selfawareness and distinguished this from the brain as the seat of intelligence hence he was the first documented western philosopher to formulate the mindâ€“body problem in the form in which it exists today dualism is contrasted with various kinds of monism substance dualism is contrasted with all forms of materialism but property dualism may be considered a form of emergent materialism or nonreductive physicalism in some sense,0
basically the issue with diabetes is insulin  think of insulin as a keycard  glucosesugar  as you and your friends  and your body s cells as a locked room with a party inside  normally  you would use a keycard to swipe the reader near the door  the door then opens  and you and your friends walk into the room  in this way  insulin changed the state of the door  from locked to unlocked  and glucoseyou  could then enter the cellroom  and keep the party going  in type 1 diabetes  there just are nt any keys  there may have been when you were young  but somebody destroyed the keycard  making machine  without you being able to get keys from elsewhere  insulin injections   you wo nt ever get in the roomglucose ca nt enter cells   without any keycards  no  one can get in and the party dies  this used to be commonly called  juvenile  diabetes as the cells which make insulin  located in the pancreas  were destroyed by the bodies immune system  in type 2 diabetes  the keycards you have just do nt work very well anymore  you sometimes have lost some  and the reader might have broken a little bit  so  sometimes the door opens and people can get in  the problem is so many people want to get in  that there s a line out the door  so  the party is still going  but all these people are sitting around with nothing to do  and start to go around the neighborhood  trashing the place  this is what happens in type 2 diabetes  you get sugar levels going way up since the insulin does nt work so well at getting it inside cells  and these high sugar levels can damage other body tissues  we re not fully sure the exact way that this happens  but it seems diet and exercise can have an effect on it  when sugar enters your body  it ca nt freely enter cells unless the insulin grants it access to these cells  in people with type 1 diabetes  the problem is insulin just does nt get produced  so the fix is simple  give these people insulin shots all day  every day  type 2 diabetes is more complicated  it s a combination of poor insulin production and reduced cellular sensitivity to insulin  it s partly genetic  and partly brought on by a life time of poor diet and exercise  as cells keep receiving an over  abundance of sugar  they stop responding to the insulin coming at them  so we give people medicines to increase their insulin production  increase cell sensitivity to insulin and reduce liver output of sugars  but unless people adjust their diets to stop this enormous input of sugar  these drugs will probably lose their efficacy over time as well  edit  the problem with high sugars is that it can bind with various structures throughout your body  limiting their function  your kidney microvessels get blocked  causing kidney disease  your nerves get damaged  glucose binds to schwann cells  usually affecting the longest first  so people stop feeling pain in their feet  if they get a cut  they do nt feel it  it turns into an infection  which they do nt feel  and it eventually invades their bone  and the leg gets amputated  mightberight s explanation was good  but in reference to your  it seems somehow common  comment i will add that many more people have type ii diabetes  the key cards do nt work so well any more  than have type i  you just do nt have any key cards   the prevalence of type ii diabetes varies from region to region  and as mightberight said  seems to have to do with diet and exercise  type i diabetes has been around probably forever  the ancient egyptians were the first to write about it   type ii diabetes might be a  disease of civilization  ,0
they have really good lawyers and lobbyists  short answer separation of church and state  yes i use that term loosely   basically from the perspective of the us government  they would go after a specific  religion  and people from all around in other religions would be up in arms because of it  the exact reason the federal government does not go directly after the catholic churches in america for all the sexual abuse  basically the fallout would be much worse than the cause  hell why not the wbc while they are at it  religious organizations that are more on the zealot side are very crafty and usually hide a team of lawyers in the background  the government is way to busy to go after them  pretty much once you are made a religion you are just free to rant and rave without breaking any laws  but you may push those laws to the red line but usually it they step back from them or know how to get around them  while i am not defending any religion but to go after one would be to go after them all  basically it boils down to this statement   congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion  or prohibiting the free exercise thereof    yes i know it sucks and some religions should own up to what they have done  doing  or did but the legal ramifications of it would be something unfathomable it s registered as a religion  it would have to do way more damage before any action will ever be taken to shut it down ,0
first off  sorry to hear it  my friend s husband just passed away from a brain tumor that he d been fighting for years  cancer sucks  cancer is a big blanket term for a bunch of different things  they all have one thing in common  the body s cells start dividing and do nt stop  normally cells have limits on them  but with cancer  they just start going nuts  they keep dividing over and over  that s what a tumor is  a bunch of cells of a particular sort that just keep dividing  depending on what sort of cancer it is  what sort of cells are dividing  there are various effects  but the endgame for most cancers is that parts of the tumor break off into the bloodstream  land somewhere else  and start growing there  your body has weird cells like this all the time  but most of the time your immune system gets em first or they do nt manage to get access to the bloodstream  nutrients and such   but when your immune system does nt get them  that s when they become a malignant cancer  so  short story  cancer is when a part of the body goes nuts and does nt stop growing  this xkcd comic sort of explains it  url0 cancer is when the cells ca nt stop reproducing  essentially skipping interphase where the cell does its job  this is what causes a tumor  which kills the person ,0

apes including gorillas chimpanzees and bonobos have the physical ability to produce some of the sounds that are used in human language however they do not have the same vocal anatomy as humans and are not able to produce all of the sounds that are used in human language in addition even if an ape were able to produce the sounds of human language it would still need to learn how to combine those sounds into words and sentences and how to use those words and sentences to communicate meaningrnrnteaching an ape to speak human language would be very difficult and would require a lot of training and practice it would also require the ape to have a very good understanding of the meaning of words and how they can be used to communicate different ideas while some apes have been able to learn a limited number of words and can understand some simple instructions they are not able to communicate as effectively as humans do using languagernrnso while it is not completely out of the realm of possibility to teach an ape to speak it would be very difficult and would require a lot of time and effort,1
leaves on a tree stay on the tree even when they are not receiving enough sunlight to make chlorophyll because they are attached to the tree by a stem the stem is what connects the leaves to the tree and helps to provide the leaves with nutrients and water even when a leaf is not able to produce chlorophyll because it is not receiving enough sunlight it can still continue to survive and function as part of the tree as long as it is able to receive nutrients and water through its stem,1
first its much safer to be shorting stocks over 5 than stocks under 5  i use 3 indicators to show that a stock has topped out and about to drop key is the timing cause the initial drop is often the biggest more close you get in at the top the higher the risk using 1d charts only    macd indicator  i use the histogram when it reaches a peak height and the next day it is down 1 step if you wait til the macd lines cross you are pretty late imho  need to get in earlier timing is everything    rsi15  needs to topped out and above 67 meaning over bought   do not buy when rsi is high above 70 often stocks go on a run up when rsi is over 70    i use stoch rsi or cci to confirm my status on rsi i like to see that all 3 indicators agree this gives me a 75 chance that the stock will drop it may take a day or 2 so you need patience,0
there are several reasons why it can be difficult to prove climate change to some people n1 the evidence for climate change is complex and can be hard to understand it involves many different factors such as the rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere the increasing temperatures of the earths surface and the melting of polar ice caps n2 some people may not believe in climate change because they do not fully understand the science behind it or because they have been misinformed about the causes and effects of climate change n3 there is often a lot of disagreement among scientists about the best way to address climate change and this can make it difficult for people to know what to believe n4 some people may be resistant to accepting the evidence for climate change because they feel that taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions would require them to make significant changes to their lifestyle or their business practices ndespite these challenges it is important to continue educating people about the evidence for climate change and the steps we can take to mitigate its impacts by working together and taking action we can make a difference and help protect the planet for future generations,1

a seizure is a sudden burst of abnormal electrical activity in the brain this can cause a person to experience changes in their behavior movements or feelings seizures can have many different causes including certain medical conditions medications or injuries to the brainrnrnduring a seizure the person may lose consciousness or be unable to speak or move normally they might also have strange sensations such as feeling tingling or numbness seeing flashing lights or hearing strange noises some people might only have a brief period of strange behavior while others might have longer seizures that involve convulsions or muscle spasmsrnrnseizures can be scary for the person having them and for people who are watching but most seizures do not cause any lasting harm if someone is having a seizure its important to stay calm and try to protect them from injury if the seizure lasts for a long time or the person is having trouble breathing its important to get medical help right away,1
an offer in compromise oic is a way for taxpayers to settle their tax debt for less than the full amount owed if you have an underwater asset an asset that is worth less than the amount you owe on it you may be able to use it as part of your oic submission to the internal revenue service irsto use an underwater asset as part of your oic you will need to complete form 656 offer in compromise and submit it to the irs along with a nonrefundable application fee and an initial payment if requiredon form 656 you will need to provide information about your income expenses assets and liabilities this will include information about any underwater assets you have you will need to provide details about the asset such as its type value and any debts associated with itthe irs will review your oic submission and determine whether you are eligible for an oic based on your financial situation and ability to pay if the irs determines that you are eligible for an oic it may offer you a compromise based on the value of your assets including any underwater assetsit is important to note that the irs generally prefers to receive payment in full and it will only consider an oic if it determines that it is unlikely that you will be able to pay your tax debt in full if you have an underwater asset it may be possible to use it as part of your oic submission but the irs will also consider your other assets and your overall financial situation when making a decision,1
sure sympathy and empathy are similar in that they both involve understanding and caring about other peoples emotions however they are not the same thing sympathy is when you understand and feel sorry for someone elses feelings or problems for example if a friend is feeling sad because their pet died you might feel sympathy for them and say something like im so sorry that happened that must be really hard for you empathy is when you not only understand someone elses feelings but you can actually feel those same emotions yourself for example if you have a friend who is feeling really happy because they just got a promotion at work you might feel happy for them and say something like congratulations im so happy for you so the main difference between sympathy and empathy is that with sympathy you feel sorry for someone elses emotions while with empathy you can actually experience those emotions yourself,1
in the united states there are two main political parties the democratic party and the republican party these parties have existed for a long time and they have a lot of support from different groups of people in other countries there may be more than two main political parties but in the united states these two parties have been able to win most of the elections and hold most of the political power its not that america is not progressive but rather that these two parties have a strong hold on the political system and it can be difficult for new parties to gain a foothold,1
as i understand it  there was a candidate in the running who wanted to have france pull a brexit  since france is a large economic force in the eu  a lot of countries would possibly be hurt if they left  and since the eu is such a large economic force in the world  if the euro suffers  the rest of the world will  as well  i ll try to give as balanced of an answer as possible  as responses will vary depending on what side of the political spectrum you reside in  essentially  the importance of the french election comes down to marine le pen  the leader of the national front party  a far  right political party that is against muslim immigration and is strongly nationalist and anti  eu  under a national front presidency  le pen has stated that she will push for a referendum for france to leave the eu  similar to brexit   if france does leave the eu  the entire union will likely dissolve  the effects of this are largely unknown  but there are some certainties about what would happen in a post  eu world  each country would have to establish a new currency  which would likely be devalued in order to boost exports  many people  especially on the political left  believe this could have disastrous economic consequences  i highly recommend listening to le pen speak to understand her views on populism  immigration  and maintaining the identity of a cultural france   watch here   url0  france is a large  populous country with a very long democratic history  like great britain  it has ruled large sections of the planet in it s time  is still a world player  is a nuclear nation and has a history for left  wing political leanings with a strong socialist tradition  it is currently being tempted by the ultra right  wing nationalist parties exemplified by ms le pen and her cohorts  it is one of the founding members of the european union and the european ideal  it is a significant indicator of european direction  opinion and likely change  if at all   recall if you will  that the recent low countries  holland et al  elections threw out it s right  wing apologists for a centre  left candidate  so the breath of many nations around the world is being held to see how the french will swing  will they remain reasonable or have matters degenerated so far that the right  wingers seem the only way forward ,0
you brain is good at knowing when the appropriate time to  go  is  so much so that it lets you be largely in charge of it  this happens because of 4 different types of nerves controlling the urinary mechanisms  sensory  afferent  nerves  which tell you your bladder is full  sympathetic   fight  flight   nerves which relax the bladder and keep the urinary sphincter tight  parasympathetic   rest  digest   nerves which contract the bladder and relax said sphincter  and somatic nerves  that act on skeletal muscles  ie muscles you can control voluntarily  which let you initiate when to go  when you are in line at fatty s pizza shack  for instance  your sympathetic nervous system  fight  flight  is keeping that bladder sphincter tightly closed  it does this without you even knowing it  much like you do nt need to consciously make your heart beat   later  after drinking your extra large floaty shake  your bladder fills with urine  and sensory nerves alert you to this fact via stretch receptors on the bladder itself  as your bladder fills with more urine  the stretch sensors cause little contractions in the bladder which you feel as urges  when you finally feel like it s a good time to pee on something  your somatic nerves signal your accessory muscles  abdominals  to assist with voiding  a fancy word for micturition which is an even fancier word for urination   and your parasympathetic nerves  rest  digest  takes the hint and squeezes the bladder and relaxes your urinary sphincter  the result is pee happening  several regions in the brain are also involved  mainly keeping you from peeing when you do nt want to pee  you can consciously keep from wetting yourself for quite a while  unless you have some sort of disease where nerves are damaged or the muscles in your bladder  detrusor muscle and sphincters  do nt cooperate  incontinence  ca nt hold it in  enuresis  bedwetting  it s the urinary sphincter not relaxing fast enough  probably due to shyness or tension  some medications can affect the sphincter causing urinary retention  i read on here somewhere  some post  about standing at the urinal  lots of dudes standing in line and it just wo nt release  this redditor stated that doing math in your head releases the muscle or whatever it is that is clammed up due to self inflicted intimidation  tried it and damn  it worked like a charm  2  24  4  48  i think i made it to 64 and was whizzing full throttle  go figure  no pun intended ,0
sure ascii stands for american standard code for information interchange its a way to represent characters like letters and symbols as numbers this way computers can store and manipulate textrnrneach character in ascii is represented by a unique number between 0 and 127 for example the number 65 represents the capital letter a the number 66 represents the capital letter b and so onrnrnthese numbers can be used in different number systems for example the number 65 can be written as 1000001 in binary a number system with only two digits 0 and 1 it can also be written as 41 in hexadecimal a number system with 16 digits 09 and afrnrni hope this helps let me know if you have any more questions,1
the common explanation involves figure skaters  and i will drag it out here with a minor change  imagine that the sun is a hockey goalie spinning in a circle in the middle of the rink  he is a huge guy  along comes a female skater who grabs his hand and is pulled into the turns that he is doing  they both feel a pull on their arms as they continue making circles  now imagine the hockey goalie has arms made of rubber  as he circles  the pull on his arms allows the rubber to stretch out and pull the girl around  she will make a pull  out  the arm will stretch  then he will pull in  and she will come closer to him  that s what happens with planets in orbit of a star  the pull of the gravity is enough to keep the planet in orbit  but the planet keeps trying to pull away  gravity does nt behave like a solid string  it s more like a rubber band  the pull changes based on how far the planet is from the sun  the rubber stretches more at some times than at others  so  consider a planet in orbit  it s got some energy from the fact that it s moving around  call that k it s got some potential energy from being in a gravitational field  let s call that one g so then the total energy t  k  g this total ca nt change  because the planet and star are nt losing energy  so if one increases  the other has to decrease  now imagine that it s in a perfectly circular orbit  this means both the energies  k and g  are fixed  because the speed and the distance from the star are constant  give the planet a push  now it s moving faster  so it ll move away from the star  but that means it has to increase it s gravitational energy  g goes up   the increase has to come from the kinetic energy  which means the planet slows down  k goes down   slowing down means it s going to fall back closer to the star  moving closer to the star means it s decreasing in gravitational potential energy  g goes back down   energy that gets converted into kinetic energy  k goes back up   this means the planet speeds up  and the whole cycle begins over again  tldr  elliptical orbits mean that the energy oscillates between kinetic and gravitational energy  circular orbits are when that does nt happen  it s slightly difficult to damp 10  25 kg of stuff oscillating  especially in space ,0

i m not sure anybody has really answered your first question  essentially  nukes are electrically detonated  so it s possible to rig up any kind of device to trigger the detonators  depending on what you want to achieve  some nukes  like icbm warheads  are intended for air bursts  these warheads might have a fusing device that depends on re  entry deceleration to arm them  then a pressure switch or altitude determining radar to detonate them at the right altitude  an an impact detonator might function as a fail safe  in case the altitude detonator does not go off  nukes that are intended to be used against subsurface bunkers might have an impact detonator  or might use the impact to arm the bomb  with a timer to detonate it after it came to rest deep in the ground  on modern nukes  the arming process might include filling a cavity in the primary with a pre  set amount of tritium  then activating a solid state neutron generator  then triggering the explosives that cause the implosion  as i understand it  by varying the amount of tritium in the core and the neutron flow from the generator  the bomb yield can be changed  dial  a  nuke   once the explosives are detonated  the process is pretty much automatic at that point  typically  modern nukes use a hollow sphere of something that is not quite dense enough to detonate by itself  the explosives squeeze it until it is dense enough to fission  and the neutron generator helps supply enough low neutrons to accelerate the reaction  the tritium in the core  if there is any  fuses from the reaction of the core  and adds to the bomb yield  if the bomb is what is typically called a hydrogen bomb  there is a secondary element  but i m late getting to bed and wo nt discuss that just now  when you get a large enough chunk of certain radioactive materials together  it explodes  in a bomb  two pieces of material  each too small to explode  are kept separate  a small conventional explosive pushes them together  forming a chunk long enough to sustain a nuclear reaction and setting off the full explosion   this is one design  of several  but that s the basic idea  the proper term for the thing that starts detonation in any bomb is the fuse  a fuse can measure something or sense something and start detonation when a preset value is reached  altitude fusing does what you d expect  as does impact fusing  an altitude fuse might use barometric pressure or a small radar altimeter as a data source  position data is another option  bomb  when you get  here  exactly  please explode  there s a good fellow  fusing might also be relevant to the delivery system  an aircraft dropped weapon  which has the funny name  gravity bomb   would likely use altitude andor impact fusing  a weapon that rides an icbm might use speed  altitude  and position data to fully confirm that it has reached its target and fire  and these sensors would be considered parts of the fusing system  torpedoes  cruise missiles  and portable demolition charges probably all have their own unique set of fusing options to suit their uses and operating environments ,0
methanol is a methyl group  a carbon atom connected to three hydrogen atoms  connected to an oh group  an oxygen atom connected to a hydrogen atom   ethanol has the methyl group connected to a hydrocarbon link  a carbon atom connected to two hydrogen atoms with two link bonds available  connected to an oh group  these are different chemicals with different properties  of particular interest  methanol is poisonous to humans and ethanol only makes humans drunk  both are used in gasoline  though the methanol is usually mbte  ethanol is the one that s like 10  in ordinary gas and 80  in e85 gas  both are flammable  so they are interchangeable if you want something to douse a building in before you burn it down  and you have a gas mask   both can be solvents  but the whole  poisonous to humans  makes methanol hard to use in a lot of situations  alcohols are a category of chemicals that all have the structure x  oh  where x is some number of carbons in a chain  so you have  methanol  c  oh ethanol  c  c  oh propanol  c  c  c  oh butanol  c  c  c  c  oh pentanol  c  c  c  c  c  oh hexanol  c  c  c  c  c  c  oh and so on  chemically they re similar to each other  but not completely interchangeable  ethanol and methanol are  not  interchangeable as drinks  ethanol gets you drunk but methanol makes you blind  you have just named two chemicals  what concept do you want explained here ,0
sure so hubbles law is a scientific idea that helps us understand how fast galaxies are moving it says that the speed of a galaxy is related to how far it is away from earth to understand this lets first think about how we measure distance one way to measure distance is to use a measuring tape if you want to know how far it is from your house to the park you could use a measuring tape to measure the distance similarly to measure the distance to a galaxy we use special instruments called telescopes telescopes allow us to see faraway objects in space and measure their distance from us now lets think about how we measure speed to measure the speed of something we need to know how far it travels and how long it takes to travel that distance for example if you want to know how fast you can run you could time yourself running a certain distance and then divide the distance you ran by the time it took you so hubbles law says that the speed of a galaxy is related to its distance from us more specifically it says that the faster a galaxy is moving the farther it is away from us and conversely the closer a galaxy is to us the slower it is moving i hope that helps let me know if you have any more questions,1
there are two separate questions here  why and how  i think the  why  is fairly obvious  there are some pretty horrific methods of warfare and ways of carrying out violence  in the past it was simply accepted that as an army passed through an area it would rape  loot and steal everything not nailed down  prisoners taken would be tortured and forced to work or fight for the enemy  this largely is no longer the case  chemical and biological weapons are more or less unused  certainly by major powers  as are mines and cluster weapons  we consider these things too horrific or non  specific  that is  they mostly target innocent civilians  there was no such thing as a war crime before the 20th century  now we have a somewhat functional justice system capable of holding people to account for their actions during war  as to how these laws are enforced  it s entirely possible  more or less by mutual agreement  gas weapons were never used in world war 2  chemical weapons have never  with the arguable exception of vietnam  but that was officially  deforestation   been used in open conflict without the total condemnation of the international community  similarly with biological agents  it works because the amount of damage using such a weapon would do to a country s diplomatic prospects  trade sanctions  general mistrust from other countries  maybe even war  is just not worth the risk  often these  non  conventional  weapons  warfare targeting the civilian population  and similar strategies are used in response to the other side using them  so by taking them off the table entirely  countries no longer need to stock up on chemical or biological weapons in the first place because they know with fair certainty that nobody else is either  hi iogan  i made this account to respond to you  it s a good question  i m sure everyone else on here has already covered alot of ground on this  but i work in international law  and have in the past worked with international criminal law  war crimes  and international humanitarian law  crimes against humanity   so i think i m  fairly well placed to respond  for the lazy tl  dr  even in the worst situations imaginable  we can chose to lessen the suffering of others  and those that chose to make others suffer unessecarily should be held to account  reading from your other questions  i think  as u  nwob notes   yoive got two questions run together here  i ll clarify them as  1  what s the purpose in trying to regulate the way 2 countries go about killing each other  it s war  why try to sanitise it  2  how are such efforts to sanitise war made agreed upon  how can they ever be implemented in practice  it is useful at this point to note that whenwe talk about  laws of war  there are 3 main catergories a  crimes against peace  invading another country  bombing another country  assasinations  promoting rebellions and regional instability  promoting post  eletion violence  b  war crimes  executing pow s  using chemcial weapons  torpedoing hospital ships  executing medics  c  crimes against humanity  genocide  retribution for military attacks against the civilians  rape as a weapon of war etc  in response to question 1  u  nwob covered it pretty nicely in his first paragraph  however  there are one or two inaccuracys which i should touch on  we can find evidence of various agreement about how war shall be waged going back to bc  documents have been found in eygpt where armies agreed not to us poisoned weapons  the rational  you hit someone with an arrow  they re done fighting for the day   ignore lotr  you do nt bravely fight on with arrows sticking out of you   there was no point in poisoning the soldiers and making them die a drawn out and agonising death  when the next result was the same  they d take no further part in the battle  this logic carried through to other war crimes  as defined above   if you can win the battle  war without causing unnessary suffering  do it that way  additionally  since roman times  we have had agreements on how pow s should be treated  the most basic being that they should nt be killed and when the war is over  they should not be tried as civilian criminal for acts committed during war   ie  you ca nt try 200 iraqi pow s who shot at american soldiers for attempted murder   the idea is that war does not mean that those involved have no morals  it means that war necessitates the evolution of a different set of morals  and even in war time  we find certain actions completely reprehensible  war can justify someone hurting and killing another  but things like genocide  mass rape etc  not even war can excuse such actions  so this is the why  in the end  even when we find ourselves in terrible situations  we are capable of cruelty and kindness  war brings enough suffering without people intentionally adding to it  in response to question 2  how are these laws enforced  as mentioned above  the rules of war have been created over several centuries  with the most basic principals being long standing  pow s civilian protections etc  and newer ones being added as relevant  prohibitions on blinding lasers etc   unfortuantely  given that war is either between two sovergin countries with no over  arching legal system  or in the case of civil wars  destroys the legal system in waging it  most enforcement tends to be reactive  as opposed to proactive  again  u  nwob explaination is great  but to expand on it  one of the biggest short comings of international law in the past has been the accusation of  victors justice   that is to say  the winning side never has to answer for when they crossed the line  think about nuclear weapons  if germany had dropped nuclear weapons on english cities  and gone on to lose the war  do you think they would of been charged for the indiscriminate murder of civilians  probably  but the side that used nuclear weapons won  and they never had to account for it  the biggest change to enforcement came under the rome statute which created the international criminal court in the hauge  netherlands   this and the associated tribunals  have since the 90 s been working to investigate  try and punish those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity since the yugoslav wars in the early 90 s  it is an independant body  of increasing reputation  which tries war crimes and major breaches of international law  hope this covers it  war is seen as a necessity  the idea is that sometimes  we have to do things we do nt like doing  because not doing them would be even worse  hitler running all over europe  killing every jew  gypsy  cripple or otherwise undesirable in sight can easily be seen as a pretty bad thing  now  a war to stop him is also a pretty bad thing  and we should prefer just talking to the likes of hitler in a reasonable voice and see where that gets us  often  not very far  and he keeps killing people at the time  lots of them  the laws about war  essentially  boil down to  oh  alright  if you absolutely have to go and kill a lot of people  then that s what you have to do  but doing  this   or  that  or the other thing with the bucket and the corkscrew  that would make you just as bad as the thing you re up against  and we d rather have the really bad guys not be on our side  thank you very much  ,0
soy is made from soybeans which are legumes that are native to east asia they are high in protein and are used to make a variety of food products including tofu soy milk and soy sauce soybeans are typically processed to extract the oil which is used in cooking and food production and to make soy protein which is used as a food ingredient and in other products the byproducts of soy processing such as soy meal and soy flour are used in animal feed and other products soy is made from soybeans which are a type of legume native to east asia soybeans are high in protein and are used to make a variety of food products including tofu soy milk and tempehnnto make soy products the soybeans are first harvested and then cleaned and hulled to remove the outer shell the beans are then soaked in water and ground into a paste which is then used to make soy milk the soy milk is then filtered and pressed to remove the soybean solids resulting in a liquid that can be used to make other soy productsnnsoy products are a popular source of plantbased protein and are used in many cuisines around the world they are also a common ingredient in many vegetarian and vegan dishes soy is made from soybeans which are a type of legume native to east asia soybeans are rich in protein and other nutrients and have been a staple food in many parts of the world for centuriesnnto make soy soybeans are first harvested and then cleaned and hulled to remove the outer shells the beans are then ground into a fine flour which can be used to make a variety of products including soy milk tofu tempeh and soy saucennsoybeans can also be processed to produce soybean oil which is used in a wide range of food products including cooking oils margarine and shortening soy protein isolate a concentrated form of protein made from soybeans is also commonly used as an ingredient in many foods including protein bars and shakesnnoverall soy is a versatile and nutritious food that is used in a wide range of products and is an important source of protein for many people around the world,1
there are a few reasons why some imported chinese products might be lower in quality and price compared to products made in other countries one reason is that labor and production costs are lower in china so products made there might be able to be sold for less another reason is that not all products made in china are of low quality  there are many highquality products made in china as well its also important to note that the quality of a product can depend on the specific company that makes it rather than the country it is made in,1
cognitive dissonance is a term that refers to the mental discomfort or tension that a person experiences when they hold two conflicting beliefs or values at the same time for example if a person values honesty but finds themselves lying to someone they may experience cognitive dissonance because these two beliefs or values are in conflict with each other to understand this concept more easily imagine that you really love chocolate ice cream but you also know that eating too much ice cream is not good for your health when you have a craving for ice cream you may experience cognitive dissonance because you want to enjoy the ice cream but you also know that its not good for you cognitive dissonance can be uncomfortable and people may try to reduce this discomfort by changing their beliefs or behavior for example if a person who values honesty finds themselves lying they may try to make up for their lie by being extra honest in the future alternatively they may try to justify their lie by convincing themselves that it was necessary or that the person they lied to deserved it cognitive dissonance is a common and natural part of human psychology and can be a powerful force in shaping our beliefs and behaviors its important to be aware of cognitive dissonance and to try to reduce it by aligning our beliefs and actions with our values and goals,1
rape culture  is a pretty wide ranging term  but it basically boils down to the idea that society  or portions of society  views the act of rape as insignificant or even trivial  common examples below  prison rape  how many jokes show up in pop culture about criminals getting raped in jail  how many cops on tv shows remind a suspect that they re going to get raped if they wind up being guilty  how often have you heard people happy that a particular criminal in the news was going to get raped a lot in prison  and that they deserve it  it s kind of fucked up that it almost seems like being raped is part of the punishment for your crimes  whatever they may be  victim blaming  how many people do you know hear about a rape accusation  and assume that the woman is lying  how many times have you heard someone assume that the woman led the rapist on  maybe by partying in the wrong place  or wearing the wrong clothing  does nt that seem kind of weird  if someone broke into your friends house  you would nt blame them for living in the wrong neighborhood  or assume that because they did nt put bars on their windows  they were asking to get robbed  no  you d encourage them to call the police  or press charges against the burglar  why should it be any different when someone gets raped  blurred consent  how many people do you know  or know of  who s weekend plans frequently involve going out to a bar  finding some drunk girl or guy  taking them home for sex  and then kicking them out the next morning  now i m not saying that it s wrong to hook up with someone at a bar from time to time  but there s a line that some people cross  if you re actively trying to get someone drunk so they ll sleep with you  that s a form of rape  oddly enough  its a form that a lot of people are perfectly ok with  in feminist theory  rape culture is the notion that there exists environments where rape and sexual violence are normalized or often just excused without conducting a proper investigation  on college campuses throughout the us  this has become a major issue given the lax treatment of many university administrations in handling rape claims by students  victims of these crimes feel they are being ignored by the staff  their claims are not being taken seriously or even investigated  there is no formal reprimand of the suspected student or faculty member  and little to no discussion or engagement of the issue with the student body at  large  rape culture is when men feel entitled to women s bodies  it s when people ask what the victim was wearing or say he  she was asking for it  instead of just blaming the rapist  it s when people ask how much the victim had been drinking  saying they should have been safer  instead of just blaming the rapist  it s when people are concerned with the football scholarships and careers of the rapists  saying these allegations will ruin their lives  rather than focusing the attention on a poor teenage girl who was passed out drunk and was raped by several of her peers with photo and video evidence ,0
economics  firstly  you have an improved mobility of labour which reduces frictional unemployment  in theory therefore  a worker can lose his job on the border between france and belgium  now  without the eu he would only be able to look for work inside of france  but with the eu he can work across the unpatrolled border without the hassle of obtaining a visa or anything like that  furthermore  trade  the eu have no tariffs within its borders  therefore  businesses started in the uk can very easily become exporters without the large costs of tariffs  consumers benefit as they have greater choice and cheaper prices  and producers benefit as they have lower average costs  also  large external tariffs reduce the impact of multinational corperations on local business   then on a social level  if i so choose i can go and live in france and then go to spain or germany for the day and i wo nt need a visa or even a passport  this is just a few of many by the way  one of the reasons it was formed was to prevent war  following 1945 and two world wars that had massively devastated europe  the eu is an attempt to make another war practically impossible  yes  people from one eu country are free to migrate to  and work in  other eu countries  people in the part of the eu that has adopted the euro currency do nt even need to exchange money when they cross the border  businesses have the same rules  instead of different rules  when selling stuff in different eu countries  so they can focus on getting their work done instead of countless different sets of rules ,0
you will often receive a lower bill if you simply wait for a second or third billing statement i was once given the advice to never pay a medical bill until after they had sent three notices because they will almost certainly reduce the amount due sounds crazy right i have excellent credit so the idea of risking it by ignoring bills disturbed me greatly and i scoffed at the advice  i then had a similar experience to you and decided to take the advice by the third statement the bill was reduced to less than half of the original with zero intervention on my part i then paid it without any impact to my credit whatsoever ive since done that every time i receive healthcare services and the bill is always reduced on subsequent statements generally to less than half of the original bill sometimes its because insurance finally got around to paying sometimes a credit is mysteriously added sometimes line items disappear without explanation line items sometimes appear over time too but the overall balance generally goes down i dont know the reason for it but it works this has happened with a variety of providers so its not just one company that does it granted i never called to negotiate the price so i cant say if i wouldve gotten a better deal by doing that i like it because it requires no time or effort on my part and it has greatly reduced my medical bills with zero impact to my credit i only have personal anecdotes to back it up but its worked for me,0

sell 200 at 142 what does that mean i havent seen the movie so i wont try to put anything in story context  sell 200 at 142 means to sell 200 units usually shares but in this case it would likely be gallons or barrels of orange juice or pounds or tons of frozen juice   in general this could mean that you have 200 units and want to sell what you have  or you could borrow 200 units from someone and sell thosethis is called a naked short  in this case it seems that what they are selling is a futures contract  with a futures contract you are promising to obtain orange juice by some future date and sell it for the agreed price  you could own an orange grove and plan to turn your oranges into juice  or you could buy a futures contract of oranges to turn into juice  or you could arbitrage two futures contracts such that one supplies the other what theyre doing here   in general people make profits by buying low and selling high  in this case they did so in reverse order  they took the risk of selling before they had a supply  then they covered their position by purchasing the supply  they profited because the price at which they bought was lower than the price at which they sold   the reason why this is necessary is that before buying the oranges the orange juice makers need to know that they can make a profit  so they sell orange juice on the futures market  then they know how much they can afford to pay for oranges on a different market  and the growers know how much they can get for oranges so they can pay people to water and pick them   without the futures markets growers and orange juice makers would have to take all the risk themselves  this way they can share risks with each other and financiers  combined with insurance this allows for predictable finances  without it growers would have to be wealthy to afford the variation in crop yields and prices,0

google maps calculates distance based on an internal database of paths  roads  ferry route and anything you can travel over count as a path  with associated  distances   they also know everything from speed limits  traffic and toll information     url1  these paths link nodes  addresses  junctions    so inside google maps the world looks very different it s just a network of connected nodes    url4  it uses this information to create a path for you   by representing the information in this form that can easily and quickly work out the best routes between two nodes taking without having to do much  calculations     url5   these details are passed to the mapping api  a program  which then draws it as an overlay on the map    url0  the map is simply an image and only used represent the information in a way in which humans understand  so it does not use the map itself find a route for you   nor does it recalculate the lengths of the roads  these are known and stored and processed for quick access  we call this caching     url2  this is way it s not affected by projection errors and has a much reduced calculation time  you are right though  the scale on a map will be off for large maps  on small scales you can assume the earth to be flat but once you get bigger than a city you start getting errors in the area of metres  a block will probably give you accuracy of millimetres to centimetres  there is no good way around this  we could provide better estimates using a model of the earth even if the earth were a perfect sphere  it s not  the  passing of the sun deforms it the same way the moon deforms the tides   url6    few examples of how on the scale of the globe the distortion gets absurd    url3  you re right  the distances  assuming you re looking at the whole route on one map  will be distorted  as for how google maps accounts for it  they do nt need to  so long as their distance calculations do nt rely on the actual 2d map  it wo nt affect anything except for the way it looks on the screen  which you know  and accept  is distorted  so all they have to do is have a 3d model of the world  use that 3d model for calculating distances  and also use the same 3d model for converting to 2d and creating their maps  what you see on google maps is just an image  it s there to help you out visually  it does nt actually calculate the distance based on that image  behind it  what you do nt see is a massive database containing road networks  this database will contain tons of information including the speed limit  if it s one  way and many many other factors including the length of the road  or the line  segment  as the roads will be represented by lines   the maps calculate the distance of your trip based on the sum of all the lengths of all the line segments used in your trip  if you d like to learn more about how this stuff works  read about gis  geographic information systems  ,0
dogs enjoy being petted because it feels good petting a dog can be a way for them to relax and feel calm dogs have special sensory receptors in their skin called touch receptors which can pick up on the sensation of being petted and make them feel good dogs also have a strong bond with their human companions and being petted is a way for them to show affection and receive affection in return dogs may also seek out petting as a way to get attention and interaction with their human friends so in short dogs enjoy being petted because it feels good and helps them feel loved and connected to their humans,1
muscles get stronger when they are used to lift or move heavy things this process is called muscle hypertrophy when you use your muscles to lift weights you are causing tiny tears in the muscle fibers your body then repairs these tears and the muscles become a little bit bigger and stronger as a result its important to give your muscles time to rest and recover after a workout because this is when they will repair and grow this is why its not a good idea to exercise the same muscle group every day its also important to eat a healthy diet that includes plenty of protein because this will help your muscles repair and grow,1
frontier markets are countries that are in the early stages of economic and political development and are considered to be less advanced than emerging markets these markets tend to be less liquid and more volatile than emerging markets and also tend to have lower levels of regulation and transparency as a result investing in frontier markets can be risky and may not be suitable for all investorshowever frontier markets can also offer significant growth potential and diversification benefits to investors who are willing to take on additional risk frontier markets are often less correlated to developed markets which means that they may not move in the same direction as the larger global markets this can make them a useful tool for portfolio diversificationit is important to thoroughly research any investment including those in frontier markets and to carefully consider your risk tolerance and investment objectives before making any decisions it may also be a good idea to consult with a financial advisor or professional before making any investments,1
insects and other bugs dont always fight in a way that looks organized or predictable to us sometimes they might attack in bursts or have a stareoff because they are trying to establish dominance or defend their territory other times they might be trying to scare off a competitor or predator or they might be trying to find an opening to attacknnits also possible that the bugs are just reacting to each others movements and trying to get an advantage in the fight just like people different bugs have different strategies and tactics when it comes to fighting some might be more aggressive while others might be more defensivennits also important to remember that bugs are much smaller than we are so their movements and behaviors might seem strange or unexpected to us but to them they are just trying to survive and protect themselves in the best way they know how,1
there are a few different techniques that actors use to cry on demand and its likely that different actors use different techniques that work best for them here are a few possible techniquesusing memories some actors think about a personal memory that makes them feel emotional and use that memory to help them cryusing imagination other actors use their imagination to create a fictional situation that would be emotional for their character and then try to feel the emotions that their character would feel in that situationusing physical techniques some actors use physical techniques to help them cry such as holding their breath or tensing certain musclesusing makeup some actors use special makeup or eye drops to help create the appearance of tearsits also possible that some actors are simply very good at getting into character and feeling the emotions of their role which makes it easier for them to cry on demand and like any skill it is possible for actors to practice and improve their ability to cry on demand,1

cheese is a big deal to the french because it has been a part of their culture and diet for a very long time france is known for its many different types of cheese which are produced in different regions of the country some of the most famous french cheeses include brie camembert roquefort and chevre each of these cheeses has its own unique flavor and texture and many people enjoy trying different types of cheese the french also use cheese in many of their dishes such as quiches and omelets which adds to its importance in their cuisine so when people think of france they often associate it with cheese because it is such a big part of the countrys culture and history,1
think of the lymph system as a doctor that s constantly making sure small things are taken care of  s0  eli5  the lymphatic system is a highway for the body s emergency services like cops  ambulances  fire trucks  and hearses to get around the lymphatic system is a system of vessels  somewhat similar to regular blood vessels  that carries lymph instead of blood  lymph does nt have any red blood cells  but it s rich in lymphocytes  aka white blood cells  and fats  it does nt benefit from the heart s pumping  since it s not a part of the circulatory system  lymph goes forward by taking advantage from your muscles  movements  and can not go backwards thanks to a system of valves  it also has  lymph nodes   which are small capsules where there are a lot of lymphocytes  they act as a defense mechanism  if a lymph node gets infected  it will become larger and hard  you can notice enlarged lymph nodes on the neck  the armpit or near the crotch  the lymphatic system exists for a few reasons  1  absorb liquids  the blood circulation loses liquids constantly  and those liquids would just stagnate in your body if it were nt for the lymphatic system  for example you d have a lot of water in your arms  2  absorb fats from the intestine  then eventually dump them into the blood  3  transport lymphocytes  this is especially important because it s connected to the thymus  the organ where lymphocytes mature  and also the bones  where lymphocytes are made  and the spleen too  anatomy student here  the lymphatic system is one system that cleans the blood  and it comprises much of the immune system  it produces  lymphocytes   which are what kill and eat harmful bacteria in the body ,0
humanâ€“computer interaction hci is research in the design and the use of computer technology which focuses on the interfaces between people users and computers hci researchers observe the ways humans interact with computers and design technologies that allow humans to interact with computers in novel ways a device that allows interaction between human being and a computer is known as a humancomputer interface hcinas a field of research humanâ€“computer interaction is situated at the intersection of computer science behavioral sciences design media studies and several other fields of study the term was popularized by stuart k card allen newell and thomas p moran in their 1983 book the psychology of humanâ€“computer interaction the first known use was in 1975 by carlisle the term is intended to convey that unlike other tools with specific and limited uses computers have many uses which often involve an openended dialogue between the user and the computer the notion of dialogue likens humanâ€“computer interaction to humantohuman interaction an analogy that is crucial to theoretical considerations in the field,0
to get military equipment for movies filmmakers usually have to go through a number of different channels first they have to get permission from the government or military to use the equipment this can be a long and complicated process and it may involve filling out paperwork getting clearance from various agencies and agreeing to certain conditions once they have permission to use the equipment they may be able to borrow it from a military base or museum alternatively they may need to rent or purchase the equipment from a company that specializes in supplying props and equipment for movies in some cases filmmakers may need to use special effects to create the appearance of military equipment rather than using real equipment this can involve using computergenerated imagery cgi or building scale models of the equipment overall getting military equipment for movies is not an easy process and it requires a lot of time effort and resources but with the right planning and preparation it is possible to obtain the equipment needed to create realistic and authenticlooking scenes for a film,1

in my area  not only does recycling sorting not happen at all to general garbage after pickup  but there is also a quota of recycling  once that quota is met for the day  the remaining recycling also goes into the landfill with the general garbage  it s not very motivating  you mean will the city sift through our trash can to find recycleables  i doubt it  the city already gives me 3 cans  trash  recycle  and green  organics   it s up to me to throw things in the correct can  i do nt see why the city would need to do extra work  trash goes to the landfill  traditionally  it s all gone to the landfill  some areas now have dirty mixed waste recycling facilities  though  that do nt require people to separate recycling and do all of the sorting at the facility ,0

assisted suicide and lethal injection are two different things assisted suicide refers to a situation where a person chooses to end their own life with the help of another person usually a doctor who provides the means for the person to do so lethal injection on the other hand is a method of execution used by some governments to carry out the death penalty on people who have been convicted of certain crimes nin assisted suicide the goal is to help a person who is suffering from a terminal illness or other severe medical condition to end their life in a peaceful and dignified manner this can be done through the use of medication that the person takes themselves or through other methods such as inhaling gases the goal is to cause the person to fall asleep and then pass away peacefully without experiencing any pain or suffering nlethal injection on the other hand is a method of execution that is intended to quickly and painlessly cause the death of the person being executed it involves injecting the person with a combination of drugs that are designed to stop their heart and other vital functions the goal is to cause the person to pass away quickly and without experiencing any pain or suffering nthe main difference between assisted suicide and lethal injection is the context in which they are used assisted suicide is used to help people who are suffering from terminal illnesses or other severe medical conditions to end their lives in a peaceful and dignified manner while lethal injection is used as a means of carrying out the death penalty on people who have been convicted of certain crimes,1
gears control how much force your car can send to the wheels  if you want to accelerate rapidly  you want to be in a lower gear  the downside to low gears is that the engine spins very fast  and so you soon ca nt make the engine go any faster  like cycling on a bike in a low gear when your legs go round as fast as they can  yet you do nt go very fast   in order to go at higher speeds  you need to shift into a higher gear  this means the engine can go at a lower speed  rpm  while the car goes at the same speed  then accelerating speeds the engine back up  which thanks to the higher gear  results in a faster speed for the car  lower gears are better for accelerating  higher gears are better for having a higher top  speed  higher gears are also more fuel efficient  since your engine wastes energy the faster it goes  if you are starting from stationary  you want to be in 1st gear  then as you accelerate to 10 mph you will hear your engine start to whine as the rpm gets high  you should now change up to 2nd gear  conversely if you are doing 70 mph on a motorway in 5th gear and slow down to 40pmh make a turning you are now in too high a gear for your speed  and the engine will struggle to accelerate  you should change down to 4th gear as you brake  so your car is ready to accelerate away afterwards  when going down a steep hill  you want to change down to a lower gear to keep your car from getting too fast  when going up hill  you also want a lower gear to provide more force to overcome gravity  lower gear   more resistance  more acceleration higher gear   less resistance  less acceleration it is something that you will need to learn as it varies by vehicle but here is a good way to get started  start your car up and let it idle  look at your tachometer  the rpm gauge   the idle rpm is the lowest safe rpm  there should be a red line displayed near the top of the gauge  this is the maximum safe rpm also referred to as the red line  now find the half way point between them  for example if you idle at 1000 rpm and redline at 5000 rpm your target shift point will be 3000 rpm  now start from a stop and accelerate at a medium  slow pace  shift up each time you hit 3000 rpm  the rpms will fall back down a bit each time you shift  take note of this  it will vary a bit depending on gear but it gives you a good idea of where you can start downshifting  once you get up to speed you can let off and start coasting  each time you get down to the low point rpm that you noted earlier you can do a downshift  the rpm should pop back up to 3000 rpm when you do this  do that a few times then start playing with the parameters  run it a little higher before you shift or try shifting a little earlier to see how the rpms are affected  as a general rule when you are at a lower rpm you are consuming less fuel  producing less power and putting less stress on the engine  the opposite is true at a high rpm  i would try to keep it in that middle range as much as possible  given my example i d recommend staying between 2000 and 4000 rpm until you feel comfortable venturing outside that range  listen to the engine  when it gets high  pitched and noisy  it s time to shift up a gear  if it starts rumbling and does nt sound smooth  shift down  these noises will match certain rpms and you ll get used to what speeds need which gears  but to start with  radio off and use your ears  you can also feel how the car responds  at the lowest speed the gear can handle  it will feel juddery and jerky  and you could floor the pedal but the car wo nt respond  in the normal range  it will pull consistently with increased pedal pressure  there s a spot towards the top of that range where it will suddenly pull much harder  and above that  you can floor it but the engine will just be high  pitched and sound rubbish  use a low gear for hills  and shift down a gear when you need a spurt of speed  eg overtaking someone quickly  so that your car is in that burst  of  power zone  take junctions in second gear ,0
national debt is money that a country owes to other people or organizations in the case of the uk the national debt is the total amount of money that the uk government owes to different lenders such as other countries banks and other financial institutions when a country needs to borrow money it can do so by selling bonds which are essentially loans that can be bought by individuals or organizations the government uses the money it receives from selling bonds to pay for things like infrastructure projects military expenses and social programs the government then agrees to pay back the money it borrowed plus interest at a later date so the â£12782 billion national debt of the uk means that the uk government has borrowed this amount of money from various lenders and has agreed to pay it back over time the government pays back the debt by using tax money and other revenue to make regular payments to the lenders i hope that helps is there anything else you would like to know about national debt,1

forest fires can be good for the forest in some ways but they can also be very dangerous and destructive when a fire burns through a forest it can clear out old trees dead leaves and other debris that can build up on the forest floor this can make room for new plants and trees to grow which can help the forest stay healthyhowever forest fires can also be very dangerous because they can spread quickly and destroy homes wildlife and even human lives thats why its important for people to be careful with fire and to make sure that fires are only started in safe waysoverall its important to be careful with fire and to understand that it can be both helpful and harmful depending on how it is used,1
cutting ones wrists is a form of selfinjury that is sometimes used by people who are experiencing emotional pain or distress it is not a healthy or safe way to cope with difficult emotions and it can lead to serious physical harm and even death people who engage in this behavior may do so because they feel overwhelmed by their emotions and do not know how to cope with them in a healthy way they may also feel a sense of control or release when they engage in this behavior it is important to remember that there are many other healthier ways to cope with difficult emotions such as talking to a therapist or trusted friend or family member engaging in selfcare activities or finding healthy ways to express emotions if you or someone you know is engaging in selfinjury it is important to seek professional help as soon as possible,1
the comprehensive answer is that on the modern battlefield  ever since wwii  weapons have been superior to armor  modern tanks survive on the battlefield against anti  tank weapons by being low to the ground and taking advantage of terrain to stay hidden or at least reduce their exposure  bipedal tanks would have the problem of not being able to take advantage of terrain for safety  and not being able to take advantage of sloping to improve the effectiveness of the armor thickness they can reasonably carry  the only potential advantage of a bipedal tank would be use in a city where they could use buildings as cover  however  even in this situation infantry with anti  tank weapons would have the greater advantage  finally  for large gundam or pacific rim sized bipedal tanks the surface pressure under their feet would tear huge furrows in the ground  making them impractical  however  smaller maybe 1 or 2 ton sized powered armor could be highly effective  offering better protection from small arms while still being able to use terrain for protection from anti  tank weapons  we can today make walking robots  but scaling them up causes problems similar to wwii era tanks  t34 ussr tank a machine with tracks and wheels weighed 26 tons  the only slightly larger german panther was 12 tons heavier  then it got to ridiculous examples like the maus  200 tons but so much internal space was filled with engines it was ineffective  scaling them up comes with problems like the square cube law  for example  if you double the size  measured by edge length  of a cube  its surface area is quadrupled  and its volume is increased by eight times  add in the maintenance time and costs  modern tanks are negative where you spend 10 hours for every 1 hour of operation  considering tanks are nt that complex and they are also a logistical nightmare too  again wwii proved this with the king tiger and the t34  the 34 was simpler  than the tigers the tigers spend much of their time being maintained  no  walking is an insanely complex procedure  we are able to walk because we have many muscles making unconscious movements to keep us upright  simply raising one foot off the floor involves shifting your weight to pull your center of gravity over the other leg to keep you upright  otherwise you ll just topple over  other than that  weight is a massive factor  the legs would never be able to support a giant robot  they d buckle under the weight  and the ground likely would nt be able to withstand it  large buildings need piles driven into the ground to stop them sinking  a giant robot would sink almost straight away ,0
theoretically  people would contribute as much as they can  and receive as much as they need  but people with power tend to exploit the system  you could  try the search bar   url1   communism is one of the most asked questions on eli5  here s a few examples    eli5  different forms of communism ie  marxism  leninism  stalinism  trotskyism    url0    eli5  what exactly is communism    url2    eli5  communism    url3  and so forth  it may be better to just look at the other posts in eli5  but i ll give you a brief answer  to the best of my knowledge  but i have not read the communist manifesto   according to marx  communism is the end all goal of an economic civilization  the first  and possibly the most important  step in this process leading to communism is the establishment of capitalism  capitalism is extremely important because it is  according to marx  the best way to universalize the mode of production  as it seems the best way of doing it  this means that capitalism is the best system in which the proletariat  workers  figure out the way to produce things most efficiently  while also polarizing the working class and the middle class  proletariat and bourgeois   somehow this polarization is necessary but i ca nt remember how at the moment  after capitalism  socialism is supposed to be the next reasonable step  where the state gains control of the modes of production and spreads the wealth evenly  which should only be a short period of time before communism steps in  communism is then the state being controlled by the workers and everything being distributed as needed  all this is important because it explains how communism is supposed to be established and  according to marx  they are all necessary steps  because of the efficiency of capitalism in the production of goods  communism will work well and everyone will theoretically want to work for the common good of supporting the utopian communist ideology  now  why has nt this worked  well we get a lot of bad cases of communism and when you look at pretty much every communist state that has existed  they have been run by totalitarian or authoritarian governments  this in reality is not the communism the marx saw  the reason these communist states did not work  in my opinion  is because most did not follow the steps the marx saw as necessary  in russia  it was not a capitalist state before it turned to communist  it was an agircultural  feudal  monarchy  which turned to communism when the industrial workers rose up against the czar  in china  the revolution was not by the workers  because there was a small industrial institution  but rather by peasants who mostly worked in rural areas and were not fine tuned in the capitalist mode of production  there are other reasons  i m sure  why communism did not work  but essentially none of the communist states followed marx s  guide  to communism  not only this  but i m not even sure if this guide would help the ideology out very much  but hey  you never know ,0
mailin rebates are a way for companies to offer discounts on their products but they require the customer to do some extra work in order to get the discount the company will advertise a product at a certain price but if the customer buys the product and then sends in a rebate form they will get some money back the idea is that the customer will be more likely to buy the product because they think they are getting a good deal even though they will have to wait to get the discountnnthe main reason companies offer mailin rebates is because they can make more money this way when a customer buys a product with a mailin rebate the company gets the full price of the product upfront but only has to give the customer some of that money back later this can be a good way for the company to make more money in the short term because they have the cash from the sale right awaynnanother reason companies offer mailin rebates is because it can be a good way to get people to try their product some customers may be hesitant to buy a product they are not familiar with but if they know they can get some money back if they dont like it they may be more likely to give it a trynnin summary mailin rebates exist because they can be a good way for companies to make more money and get people to try their products however they can be a hassle for customers because they have to do extra work and wait to get the discount,1
colors like brown silver and copper are not part of the spectrum of colors that we see in a rainbow because they are not pure colors a pure color is a single wavelength of light like the colors in a rainbowrnrninstead these colors are made up of a mixture of different wavelengths of light for example the color brown is made up of a mixture of red orange and yellow light when these different wavelengths of light are mixed together they create the color brownrnrnso even though brown silver and copper are not part of the rainbow spectrum they can still be seen because they are made up of a combination of the colors that are in the spectrum,1
a boltzmann machine is a type of neural network that can learn to reconstruct a probability distribution over its inputs by learning to stochastically reproduce a training set it is an unsupervised learning model which means that it does not require labeled training data to learn the structure of the input datannnnboltzmann machines are composed of a set of binary units that are connected by weighted edges the weights of the edges represent the strength of the connection between the units the units are arranged in layers with the input units comprising the bottom layer and the output units comprising the top layernnnnthe learning process in a boltzmann machine involves adjusting the weights of the edges between the units based on the probability of the units being activated given the input data this process is known as learning by contrastive divergencennnnboltzmann machines have been used for a variety of tasks including image recognition natural language processing and anomaly detection they are particularly wellsuited for tasks that involve modeling large complex data sets with many variables since they can learn to capture the underlying structure of the data through unsupervised learning,1
it s highly unlikely you re going to die  what is happening is that as you stand up your blood pressure drops  this can cause you to feel dizzy or even go temporarily blind as the blood takes a second to make it to your now elevated head   more info   url0  in case you re curious  this started happening to me when i hit about 511  and now that i m 62  i have to be careful getting up fast from laying down  i read a lpt on reddit that said when this starts to happen to flex your abs as hard as you can  i do nt know if there is any real science behind it but it works like a charm for me  never felt light headed for more than a second since  you most likely have low blood pressure to begin with  so sending all the blood up  against gravity  mind you  is difficult for your body to do on such short notice  standing up quickly   if you get up more slowly  your circulatory system can keep up and you wo nt experience much blindness  if any  here s where i will get a little more serious  you need to know certain things that can cause your blood pressure to lower  for example  coughing causes your blood pressure to lower  so does sleeping  if you are sick with a cough  do not get out of bed quickly  i did this and was blinded for a full five minutes  fucking terrifying  wake up  lie there for a little bit  sit up for a little bit  then stand up out of bed  now  a little more serious  if you find that this blindness is happening all too often  you may have some form of dysautonomia  all that is happening is that your circulatory system and your nervous system are nt too quick at communicating with one another  this is most critical when you have changes in gravity upon your body   lying down  gravity is pretty spread out upon your body  standing up  it s more dramatic   a  tilt table  test is often used to see the correlation between nervous and circulatory systems  you lie down on a table for about 10  15 minutes  then they strap you down  nothing crazy  just for safety  and slowly tilt the table until you are almost upright  almost upright  i forget the exact degree of the angle  but you are not 90 degrees upright  you are leaned back ever so slightly  what this does is place the job of getting blood to your head entirely upon your heart and the capillaries  so no help from the muscles you use to stand  walk  etc    it seems harmless  but crazy shit can happen in this test  limbs can go numb  vomiting can occur  dizziness  blindness  and pain are not uncommon  it may sound really cliche  but what do you think helps your nervous system and circulatory system communicate more quickly  electrolytes  so get yourself some smart water or some propel water and you ll notice this aspect of your life becoming a lot better  source  all this shit has happened to me  and for more info i m 60  and 130 lbs  and now i love propel ,0
it looks better because of the lack of pixels  lights in old tvs  which gave 3d objects a smoothing  fuzzy  ish effect  you could say less is more  when you play an old game on a new tv  you can see the sharpness and edges and that s why it looks funny  also they were nt designing much for hi  def tvs since nobody really had them at the time  most computers were still big  boxy monitors   you wo nt be imagining the lag either  modern tv have all kinds of processing stuff going on which does cause very small but potentially noticeable lag  this varies depending on how good your tv is  also  check to see if it has a gaming mode which reduces the processing on the image  and thus the lag   the n64 was part of the last generation of consoles to have analog output only  and was made to work with an analog tv  so it has lots of little tricks in the graphics that would take advantage of analog s impreciseness to hide bad  looking bits modern tvs are digital  and while they re compatible with analog  the tricks to hide  rough spots  do nt work on them  the same is true of any other console of the n64 s era  or before it   side note  this is also why videotapes and laserdiscs look worse on non  crt tvs   some people  have actually made little circuitboards that go between the console output and the tv   url0  and add in fake scanlines and ghosting  to make old games look better on new tvs ,0
i remember when i was younger you could dial an automated  that would give you the correct date and time  i remember after power outages we would call that  and reset our clocks  before that  clock towers at federal buildings in squares or at train stations were used to set clocks as well as church bells would ring at the time of day for prayers or throughout the day at each hour  morning  noon vespers  and those bells were set by sundials or town square clock towers  church bells people  they ring the time every hour  must have done so since the middle ages  any experts on that  is it only a dutch thing  before the internet  i remember my dad would tune a scanner or short  wave radio to a certain station  frequency that had a ticking sound for every second and would announce the time every minute  if i remember  i ll call him later and ask him more specific stuff about it  edit  url0  wwv is the call sign of the united states national institute of standards and technology s  nist  hf   shortwave   radio station near fort collins  colorado   edit2  well  i just realized the op wants to know before radio  so this is useless  i m going to leave the comment up though in case anyone finds it interesting ,0

gendered nouns also known as grammatical gender are a way that many languages classify nouns and pronouns in languages with grammatical gender each noun is assigned a gender usually masculine or feminine and the gender of the noun often determines the form of other words in a sentence such as articles and adjectivesits not clear why so many languages have developed grammatical gender but it is thought to be a feature that has evolved over time in many different language families some theories suggest that grammatical gender may have originally been based on natural gender the gender of living beings as male or female but in many languages the connection between grammatical gender and natural gender is not very strongenglish is unusual in that it does not have grammatical gender at least not in the same way as many other languages instead english relies on natural gender to determine the gender of pronouns and other words that refer to people or animals for example we use he to refer to a male person and she to refer to a female person in english the gender of a noun is usually indicated by the pronoun that is used to refer to itits worth noting that not all languages have grammatical gender and some languages have more than two genders for example some native american languages have a gender system with multiple classes such as animate and inanimate,1

the theory of evolution is a scientific explanation for how species of living things have changed and developed over time some christians may have concerns about the theory of evolution because it conflicts with certain religious beliefs such as the idea that god created all living things in their present formrnrnfor some people their religious beliefs are very important to them and they may feel that the theory of evolution challenges or undermines those beliefs they may also feel that the theory of evolution is incompatible with the idea that human beings are unique and special created in the image of godrnrnits important to remember that peoples beliefs and opinions can be complex and multifaceted and it is not always possible to fully understand someone elses perspective however it is possible to have a respectful and openminded dialogue about different viewpoints and to try to understand and appreciate each others perspectives,1

sound travels through the air at a speed of about 343 meters per second which is faster than the speed of light however it can take some time for the sound of an explosion to reach a person if they are far away from the source of the explosion in the case of the volcano eruption you mentioned it is possible that the sound of the explosion took almost 15 seconds to reach the people on the boat because they were a significant distance away from the source of the explosion this is similar to how it can take a few seconds for the sound of a thunderstorm to reach you after you see the lightning,1
if the shares you own are delisted from a stock exchange it may be more challenging to sell them here are a few options you may want to considercheck if the company is still in business and if it has a direct investment plan some companies allow shareholders to sell their shares directly back to the companycontact a brokerage firm to see if they are willing to sell the shares on your behalf keep in mind that it may be difficult to find a broker who is willing to handle the sale of delisted shareslook for online forums or online marketplaces where you may be able to find buyers for the sharesconsider consulting with a financial advisor or a lawyer to discuss your options they may be able to provide additional guidance on how to sell your delisted sharesits important to keep in mind that delisted shares may be difficult to sell and may not have much value you may want to carefully consider whether it is worth the time and effort to try to sell these shares it may be difficult to sell small amounts of delisted shares you may want to try contacting a broker or financial institution to see if they are willing to buy the shares from you you could also try posting an advertisement online or in a local newspaper to see if anyone is interested in purchasing the shares from you keep in mind that it may be difficult to find a buyer for delisted shares and you may have to sell them for significantly less than their original purchase price its always a good idea to consult with a financial professional before making any decisions about selling securities,1
one small change early in a process can have drastic unintended or unanticipated consequences  due to a multiplier effect  a butterfly flapping its wings at a given location at a given time can  in theory  potentially cause a hurricane to form thousands of miles away  or  in the sci  fi time travel trope  if you traveled back in time and accidentally stepped on a butterfly  you could completely change the future   an easy visual example is this image    url0  if you were to start the double pendulum at a slightly different position  even by a hair  the end result would look drastically different  there s a certain scene in jurassic park that i like for the explanation it gives for chaos theory  a drop of water falls onto the back of your hand and runs down your skin before dropping off to the floor  another drop lands in the exact same place and runs off in another direction  tiny changes in the air  the way your skin is contoured  maybe even a slightly different level of material contaminant in the water has sent it on a different course  the idea is you ca nt predict what is going to happen next  there is no order in the course of events  and causality is inherently chaotic  of course  there are some things that are entirely predictable  if you let go of an object it will drop due to gravity  every time  but it will bounce a different way every time  and the circumstances that allow that to happen are what chaos theory is all about  have you even seen a pool game brake the same way twice  have you seen a football kick identical to one before it  to the inch  what causes the difference are things so small  barely if not at all measurable  but the effects they produce are very profound and measurable  it was believed for a long time that if you knew all of the parts and forces of a system you could mathematically map what that system would be like in the future without much difficulty  for example  when newton figured out how gravity worked  close enough given their technology  he could predict where a planet would be far in the future just by setting the time variable in his formula and a few calculations  no matter how far in the future he wanted  the calculation woud take about the same amount of time  for a while  folks thought that if we understood things well enough we would eventually come down to simple equations like this  unfortunately  some problems continued to defy simple computation  looking at gravity  still  calculating the positions of two bodies  the sun and a planet  is simple  but calculating the positions of three bodies becomes a whole lot more difficult  if you set up your bodies in one starting configuration and you calculate  step by step  into the future  you will get one result  but if you start from  very  slightly different positions  or if you change the length of the steps you are calculating  you get wildly different results  there are many problems which have these characteristics including the  double pendulum   url0   a chaotic system is not  random  in the sense that our models of it are completely deterministic  but it is very sensitive to slight variations in conditions and future states ca nt be calculated without calculating all intermediary states ,0

daylight saving time is a way to make better use of the daylight hours in the summer during the summer the days are longer which means that the sun rises and sets later this means that the hours when it is light outside are longer but the hours when it is dark are shorternndaylight saving time is a way to shift the clock so that the hours when it is light outside are even longer when we spring forward and set the clocks ahead by one hour it stays light outside for an extra hour in the evenings this can be helpful because it gives people more time to do outdoor activities or just enjoy the sunshinennin the fall when we fall back and set the clocks back by one hour it gets dark outside earlier this can be helpful because it means that people are more likely to be awake and inside when it is dark outside which can save energy because they are not using lights as muchnnoverall the purpose of daylight saving time is to make better use of the daylight hours and to save energy,1
alcohol is a substance that can affect your mood and behavior when you drink it different types of alcohol can affect people in different ways and its not always easy to predict how someone will feel after drinking a certain type of alcoholnnone reason different types of alcohol might make you feel different is because they contain different amounts of alcohol and other ingredients for example beer generally contains less alcohol than vodka or tequila so it might make you feel more relaxed and less intoxicated vodka and tequila on the other hand are often stronger and can make you feel more intoxicated more quicklynnanother reason different types of alcohol might make you feel different is because they can affect your body in different ways some types of alcohol can cause you to feel more energetic or talkative while others can make you feel more drowsy or sluggishnnits also important to remember that everyone is different and can react to alcohol in different ways some people might feel happy after drinking beer while others might feel angry or sad its always a good idea to drink responsibly and in moderation and to be aware of how alcohol can affect you and your mood,1
hr here  there s actually a variety of reasons  first off  most businesses are by law  equal opportunity employers   so they need to log diversity  otherwise you risk litigation  insurance  for the business  insurance may be greater for minorities  for example  health insurance premiums  if covered by employer  are about three times as expensive for women as they are for men  tax breaks  in my state  we get hefty tax breaks if we hire native americans  we also get tax incentives if we have women in management  also  i like to think its pretty  good  to have a diverse office  if everyone comes from a different background  everyone can bring a different set of skills to the table  this data is stored  so that if any legal accusations hit the organization later  they can show their hiring statistics  if you do not fill it out  a hr professional looks you up and down and fills it in for you   source  hr friend  my friend is a potpourri of races and i love that her race  ethnicity ca nt be interpreted by just looking at her  i m pretty sure most large employers have a quota of ethnicities  gender  and disabled people they want to meet so they can pride themselves on being a diverse company  i m not sure if skipping this would ultimately have any influence on your application s success ,0
computeraided detection cade also called computeraided diagnosis cadx are systems that assist doctors in the interpretation of medical images imaging techniques in xray mri endoscopy and ultrasound diagnostics yield a great deal of information that the radiologist or other medical professional has to analyze and evaluate comprehensively in a short time cad systems process digital images or videos for typical appearances and to highlight conspicuous sections such as possible diseases in order to offer input to support a decision taken by the professionalncad also has potential future applications in digital pathology with the advent of wholeslide imaging and machine learning algorithms so far its application has been limited to quantifying immunostaining but is also being investigated for the standard he stainncad is an interdisciplinary technology combining elements of artificial intelligence and computer vision with radiological and pathology image processing a typical application is the detection of a tumor for instance some hospitals use cad to support preventive medical checkups in mammography diagnosis of breast cancer the detection of polyps in colonoscopy and lung cancerncomputeraided detection cade systems are usually confined to marking conspicuous structures and sections computeraided diagnosis cadx systems evaluate the conspicuous structures for example in mammography cad highlights microcalcification clusters and hyperdense structures in the soft tissue this allows the radiologist to draw conclusions about the condition of the pathology another application is cadq which quantifies eg the size of a tumor or the tumors behavior in contrast medium uptake computeraided simple triage cast is another type of cad which performs a fully automatic initial interpretation and triage of studies into some meaningful categories eg negative and positive cast is particularly applicable in emergency diagnostic imaging where a prompt diagnosis of critical lifethreatening condition is requirednalthough cad has been used in clinical environments for over 40 years cad usually does not substitute the doctor or other professional but rather plays a supporting role the professional generally a radiologist is generally responsible for the final interpretation of a medical image however the goal of some cad systems is to detect earliest signs of abnormality in patients that human professionals cannot as in diabetic retinopathy architectural distortion in mammograms groundglass nodules in thoracic ct and nonpolypoid â€œflatâ€ lesions in ct colonography,0
it does nt  time passes normally for you even when you re moving quickly past things  but when you see someone else travelling quickly past you  it looks to you as though time is moving normally for you and slower for them  and actually  it s exactly the other way around for them  it looks to them as though time is moving slowly for you and normally for them  this seems surprising  but it s no more so than many other things we experience every day  consider the fact that you look small to them from a distance even though they also look small to you  here you go  url0 from u  corpuscle634 best way i ve heard it explained is nt really scientific  but it helps you visualize something more concrete to base the concept on  imagine a clock that is basically a photon bouncing between two parallel mirrors  let s say the definition of a second is one trillion bounces back and forth between the mirrors  now we have a clock that should look something like this                                     sorry if the formatting gets off  so you have this clock with a photon bouncing back and forth super fast  so normally if you move the whole clock  nothing happens  at human  comprehensible speeds  there s no significant effect  but picture the clock moving horizontally at incredible speeds  when the photon bounces off one mirror  it ca nt go straight back up  it needs to travel at an angle to hit the top mirror  since the mirror has moved during the photon s travel time   this means it must travel farther for each bounce  so our clock slows down  hope that helps visualize it ,0

when you put a hot liquid in a blender it can explode because hot liquids are under more pressure than cold liquids when the hot liquid is blended the blades of the blender can create tiny bubbles in the liquid as these bubbles expand they can cause the pressure inside the blender to increase if the pressure gets too high it can cause the liquid to burst out of the blender like an explosion nanother reason hot liquids can explode in a blender is because heat causes molecules to move around faster when you blend a hot liquid the blades of the blender can cause the molecules to move around even faster which can create more pressure inside the blender nits also important to be careful when blending hot liquids because the blender can become very hot and the steam from the hot liquid can cause the lid to blow off which can be dangerous noverall the combination of pressure and heat can cause hot liquids to explode in a blender,1

i would like to first point out that there is nothing special about a selfmanaged investment portfolio as compared to one managed by someone else with some exceptions you can put together exactly the same investment portfolio yourself as a professional investor could put together for you not uncommonly too at a lower cost and remember that cost is among the if not the best indicators of how your investment portfolio will perform over time diversification is the concept of not putting all your eggs in one basket the idea here is that there are things that happen together because they have a common cause and by spreading your investments in ways such that not all of your investments have the same underlying risks you reduce your overall risk the technical term for risk is generally volatility meaning how much in this case the price of something fluctuates over a given period of time a stock that falls 30 one month and then climbs 40 the next month is more volatile than one that falls 3 the first month and climbs 4 the second month the former is riskier because if for some reason you need to sell when it is down you lose a larger portion of your original investment with the former stock than with the latter diversification thus is reducing commonality between your investments generally but not necessarily in an attempt to reduce the risk of all investments moving in the same direction by the same amount at the same time you can diversify in various ways do you see where i am going with this a welldiversed portfolio will tend to have a mix of equity in your own country and a variety of other countries spread out over different types of equity company stock corporate bonds government bonds  in different sectors of the economy in countries with differing growth patterns it may contain uncommon classes of investments such as precious metals a poorly diversified portfolio will likely be restricted to either some particular geographical area type of equity or investment focus on some particular sector of the economy such as medicine or vehicle manufacturers or so on the poorly diversified portfolio can do better in the short term if you time it just right and happen to pick exactly the right thing to buy or sell this is incredibly hard to do as you are basically working against everyone who gets paid to do that kind of work full time plus computeralgorithmbased trading which is programmed to look for any exploitable patterns it is virtually impossible to do for any real length of time thus the welldiversified portfolio tends to do better over time,0
dogs and cats are considered omnivores which means that they can eat both plantbased and animalbased foods this means that they have the necessary enzymes to digest plantbased foods like rice rice can be a good source of energy for dogs and cats and it can also be useful as a bland easily digestible food if your pet is feeling sick or has an upset stomach that being said rice should not be the main component of a dog or cats diet both dogs and cats need a balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrients and a diet that is primarily made up of rice or other grains may not provide all of the nutrients that your pet needs its important to consult with a veterinarian or a pet nutritionist to determine the best diet for your specific pet,1

in most video games the music is stored as a digital audio file such as an mp3 or wav file when the game needs to play the music it loads the file into memory and starts playing it using the games audio systemto make the music loop seamlessly the game designers will usually create a version of the music that has a smooth transition between the end and the beginning this might involve fading out the last few seconds of the music and fading in the first few seconds of the music or it might involve using a special effect to blend the two parts togetherwhen the music reaches the end of the file the games audio system will automatically start playing it again from the beginning because the transition between the end and the beginning is smooth the looping will be seamless and you wont be able to tell where the loop starts and endsin some cases the game might have a longer version of the music that includes an intro section and a looping section in this case the game will play the intro section once and then loop the looping section until the game is told to stop playing the music,1

each nba team is a franchise  not unlike the fast food chain down the street  what does the owner at your local burger king or taco bell do  not only is he  she the overall manager  director for that franchise  but he must also comply with franchise rules and restrictions  and above all  the owner pays salaries it varies depending on the individuals  some choose to be simply the financiers of the franchise  they pay salaries to the players  staff  management and if they own the arena where the team plays their games  they pay those folks as well  that s pretty much the minimum they re responsible for  as they can hire staff to take care of everything else  some owners  jerry jones of the dallas cowboys comes to mind  are much more involved  jones acts as the teams general manager  a position responsible for player personnel and team staff  so while he owns the team and pays salaries  he doubles as a gm  and is involved in everything involving the  product   which is the team  coaching staff  that would involve drafting players  contract negotiations  cutting down a roster  signing free agents  and managing the coaching staff  those are the two extremes at this time  al davis  who passed a few years ago actually owned  coached and was the commissioner of the league during his years with the raiders  in the case of the washington redskins  the owner is in charge of micromanagement ,0
animal rights is a philosophical belief that animals as sentient beings have moral rights that should be considered and protected those who advocate for animal rights believe that animals deserve to be treated with respect and kindness and that they should not be used or exploited for human benefit they argue that animals have the capacity to experience pleasure pain and other emotions and that they should not be subjected to unnecessary suffering or harm animal rights advocates believe that animals have the right to live their lives free from human interference and exploitation and that they should be allowed to live in a manner that is natural and appropriate for their species they may also believe that animals have the right to be protected from human activities that could harm them such as hunting factory farming and animal testing,1
there s no universal answer  since contracts can be written in many different ways  but some sort of revenue share is going to be pretty common  the simplest example would be if an artist allows a publisher to sell their music in any which way  with a percentage  based revenue split  most artists  including musicians  authors  and so on  will end up assigning copyright to their publishers  so that the publisher ends up owning the piece  this makes it easier for the publisher to make business deals and enforce copyright protections  since they re well  equipped for doing that  hopefully the artist gets a good deal out of it  too  usually if the song is not a huge part of the film  like in this example   the artist receives a fixed amount of money  the advertising from the film completes it  i m pretty sure the movie studio just pays a sum to the record label who distributes it to producers and musicians accordingly,0
in the united states most cars have the gas tank on the drivers side which is the left side of the car this is because the majority of roads in the united states are designed with the drivers side on the right side of the road having the gas tank on the left side of the car allows the driver to easily access the gas cap and fill up the tank without having to walk around to the other side of the car nhowever some cars particularly luxury and sports cars may have the gas tank on the passenger side which is the right side of the car this is because these types of cars are often designed with a focus on performance and handling and placing the gas tank on the opposite side of the car can help to balance the weight distribution and improve the cars handling noverall the placement of the gas tank in a car is largely a matter of design and engineering and there are pros and cons to both sides ultimately the decision to place the gas tank on the left or right side of the car depends on the specific requirements and goals of the cars design,1
carbon14 dating also known as radiocarbon dating is a method of determining the age of an object that contains organic material by using the properties of carbon14 a radioactive isotope of carbon carbon14 is present in all living things in a constant amount but when an organism dies the carbon14 it contains begins to decay at a predictable rate by measuring the amount of carbon14 remaining in an object scientists can determine how long it has been since the organism diednncarbon14 dating is used to date a wide range of materials including wood bones and textiles it is especially useful for dating materials that are too old to be dated by other methods such as objects from the ancient world carbon14 dating is a useful tool for archaeologists paleontologists and geologists because it allows them to determine the age of organic materials with a high degree of accuracy it is also used in a variety of other fields including geology forensics and environmental science ntoo many requests in 1 hour try again later carbon 14 dating also known as radiocarbon dating is a method of determining the age of an object that was once living by measuring the amount of carbon14 a radioactive isotope of carbon it contains carbon14 is present in all living things in small amounts and when an organism dies it stops absorbing carbon14 the carbon14 in the organisms remains begins to decay and the rate at which it decays is used to estimate the age of the specimennncarbon 14 dating is a type of radiometric dating which uses the decay of radioactive isotopes to determine the age of materials radiometric dating is based on the principle that certain isotopes or types of atoms decay at a known rate over time by measuring the amount of a particular isotope present in a sample scientists can determine how long ago the material was formed or how long it has been since a process occurrednncarbon 14 dating is most commonly used to determine the age of organic materials such as wood bone and shells it is also used to date archaeological and geological materials including ancient artifacts and rocks the technique is particularly useful for materials that are too old to be dated using other methods such as materials that are over 50000 years old,1
face blindness also known as prosopagnosia is a condition that makes it difficult for a person to recognize faces even of people they know well its not related to their ability to see clearly or to their overall intelligence its also not something that people can control or changernrnimagine you have a box full of toys and each toy is a different shape and color you might have a toy car that is red and has four wheels a toy airplane that is blue and has wings and a toy robot that is silver and has buttons you can easily pick out the car the airplane and the robot because they each have unique features that help you recognize themrnrnnow imagine that you have a box full of toy people and each person looks a little different they might have different hairstyles different facial expressions and different clothes for someone with face blindness it might be hard to tell the toy people apart because their features arent as distinct they might look at a toy person and see a face but they cant tell which toy person it isrnrnit can be frustrating and confusing for someone with face blindness to not be able to recognize faces but there are ways to cope with the condition for example some people with face blindness use other clues like the persons voice to help them recognize people others might rely on context like the location or situation to help them figure out who someone is,1
condoms have expiration dates because they can deteriorate over time just like other products condoms are made of materials like latex or polyurethane which can break down and become less effective at protecting against pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections stis as they age the expiration date is a way for the manufacturer to ensure that the condom will be at its most effective when usedrnrnits important to use a condom that is not expired because an expired condom may break or tear more easily which could lead to unintended pregnancy or the transmission of stisrnrnits also important to store condoms properly heat light and humidity can all cause condoms to break down more quickly so its best to store them in a cool dry placernrnits always a good idea to check the expiration date before using a condom and to replace any condoms that have expired this will help you stay safe and protect your health,1

to quote john steinbeck   socialism never took root in america because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires   you ca nt vote against the oppressors if your one secret wish is to join them one day  people are told that their economic problems are due to welfare queens and illegal immigrants taking our jobs  this exploits our natural  us vs them  tendencies and many people do nt have the desire to examine complex issues in any in  depth manner  for the most part  poorer people want less income disparity  the problem is that poorer people tend to be less educated  which tends to makes them less able to critically examine what media sources tell them  remember  the only reason a politician seems stupid is because you disagree with his  her platform  without the ability to evaluate a platform and its effects on a socioeconomic class  poorer people tend to have to rely on other means of deciding who to vote for  so the most common criteria used are party affiliation  probably the most important and the most static   appearance  oratory skills  non  economic issues  poorer people do nt necessarily realize that the people they support are nt in favor of helping them  or  and hear me out  maybe i m wrong and the theories and policies held by lot s of the politicians poorer people are voting for are correct  after all  there is a large number of people who seem to agree with what they say  it s a complex issue and a viscous cycle and there s plenty of silly things to say about most voting groups and politicians ,0
severe headaches shortness of breath and rapid heart rate can be caused by a number of different conditions it is possible that you are experiencing these symptoms due to an underlying medical condition such as an infection high blood pressure or heart disease it is also possible that you are experiencing these symptoms due to a stress or anxiety disorder it is important to speak with a healthcare professional to determine the cause of your symptoms and receive proper treatmentnnregarding your esr erythrocyte sedimentation rate level it is normal for this value to be slightly higher in some people and lower in others in general a normal esr value is typically between 0 and 20 millimeters per hour for men and 0 and 30 millimeters per hour for women however it is important to note that the normal range for esr can vary depending on the laboratory that is performing the test and the specific method used to measure the esr it is also important to note that the esr is just one of many tests that can be used to evaluate a persons health and it is not a specific diagnostic test for any particular condition therefore it is important to discuss the results of all of your medical tests with a healthcare professional who can provide more information about what the results mean and what they suggest about your overall health,1

there are a few reasons why chinese products might be cheaper even though they have to be shipped a long way to the usrnrnlabor costs in china labor costs are generally lower than in the us this means that it might be cheaper to manufacture products in china and then ship them to the us rather than manufacturing them in the usrnrneconomies of scale china has a very large population and a large manufacturing sector which means that they can produce a lot of products at a lower cost per unit when a company produces a lot of something it can spread the cost of the production process such as the cost of raw materials and machines over a larger number of units which makes each unit cheaperrnrntrade agreements the us and china have trade agreements in place that allow for the free flow of goods between the two countries this means that it is relatively easy and inexpensive to ship products from china to the usrnrncompetition there is a lot of competition among companies that manufacture products in china which helps to keep prices low when companies are competing with each other to sell products they often try to keep their prices as low as possible to attract more customersrnrnits important to note that not all chinese products are cheaper than similar products made in the us some products might be more expensive to manufacture in china due to the cost of raw materials or other factors its also worth considering that some products such as food and certain types of clothing might be cheaper to produce locally due to transportation costs,1
when a film makes more money than its budget it is considered to be profitable this means that the people who made the film such as the producers and studio will make more money than they invested in making the film nthe money that a film earns is typically divided among several different groups of people these groups may include the producers the studio the actors the director and other crew members who worked on the film the exact distribution of the money will depend on the contracts and agreements that were made before the film was made nin general the producers and the studio will receive a larger share of the profits because they were the ones who took the financial risk of making the film the actors and other crew members will usually receive a smaller percentage of the profits nit is also important to note that the distribution of profits can be a complex process and it is not always easy to determine exactly how much money each person involved in the film will receive however the goal is usually to fairly distribute the profits among all of the people who contributed to the films success,1
the reason that the familiar copy and paste keyboard shortcuts ctrlc and ctrlv dont work in the command line is because the command line was designed to use different keyboard shortcuts for these actions in the command line the keyboard shortcuts ctrlc and ctrlv are used for different purposes ctrlc is used to terminate a running command or process for example if you run a command that takes a long time to complete you can use ctrlc to stop it ctrlv is not a valid keyboard shortcut in the command line the command line was designed to be a powerful and efficient way to work with your computer and the use of different keyboard shortcuts is part of that design it might be a little bit confusing at first but youll get used to it with time and practice,1
your impression about banks and bankers is very wrong  wall street banks can and often do lose in transactions  in fact banks go bankrupt andor require massive bailouts to survive because they sometimes lose a ton of money  the business of investment banking often involves bearing risk for customers which by definition means they lose some of the time  generally the risks they take on individual transactions are not large enough to bring the whole bank down but sometimes they are  banking is a job like any other except that it has more risk than most anyway to your point how do underwriters make money on shares that fall in value before the sale  on the commission  the issuing company will normally pay the investment bank a percentage of the funds raised in the offering regardless of the price  of course its possible for the bank to still lose money if their contract stipulates a minimum price and they are not able to meet it  in that case the bank may lose on that offering contradicting your preconceived notion by the way one other question implicit in your post why was the secondary offering considered bad news  if the ceo and other insiders have private information that indicates that the stock is overvalued then doing a secondary offering at the inflated price will greatly enrich them  because this happens some times investors are wary about secondary offerings  this makes companies that would otherwise do a secondary offering shy away from it even if shares are not overpriced  therefore if a company is doing a secondary offering the market is likely to worry that the stock is overvalued even at a reduced price,0
starlight is from so far away  it s essentially a single point of light with near zero diameter  when the atmosphere refracts that light  you can notice it more  because the amount of refraction is greater than the diameter of the source  light from planets is refracted too  but since they re a lot closer the source is nt zero diameter  it s just slightly bigger  the refraction is more obscured by the diameter of the light source  so  planet light is dimmer light  but coming from a larger diameter source  planets twinkle too  twinkle is caused by the earth s atmosphere being inconsistent density which causes varying refraction angles  sometimes strong sometimes not  any light that goes thru the atmosphere twinkles  if you were on the iss and look at the stars  they do nt twinkle  the answer to the second half of your question has to do with the two different types of light detecting cells in our eyes  they are called â€œ rods â€ and â€œ cones â€  rods are good at detecting dim objects  stars in this case  while cones are good at detecting bright objects  it just so happens that the center area of our vision is mostly handled by the cones  while our peripheral vision is handled more by the rods  so when you look a little off to the side  you â€™re forcing your eye to use the more light  sensitive rods  this technique is called â€œ averted vision  â€ most people need to look 5  20 degrees to one side or the other for the best effect ,0

there are a bunch of things going on here  first  that ship sits low in the water  with most of the weight below the waterline  that helps keep the ship upright by keeping the weight low  and using all that water to help keep the ship from tipping over  the keel of a sailing ship is usually lead for that reason  second  that video shows the ship heading into the wave dead on  to flip it over  the wave would have had to flip the ship up over the back end  the stern   third  that ship s built big and tough  it can take a pounding due to the materials and design it s been made with  it ll probably need minor repairs back in port  but it can take a few monster waves and be fine  all ships are designed so that they ca nt tip over unless they run full of water  the trick is to make sure that the center of gravity moves in the opposite direction relative to the center of buoyancy  center point of the lift force  if it starts tipping  wikipedia has a good  graphic   url0  to demonstrate that  on the left  you have a stable ship  where the cg is below the cb  as the ship starts tipping to the right  the cg moves to the left of the cb  so the force of gravity rotates the ship in the other direction  so although it looks like these huge cargo ships can easily tip over  it actually takes a lot of effort to tip them over  it usually only happens when the hull gets damaged  and water starts sloshing around inside   midst  not mist not trying to be rude  just a friendly tip  in case this was nt a typo   i ve heard the word mist used where midst should ve been a few times lately  i refuse to sit idly by while the word midst gets forever  buried under a pile of mist  ,0

thunder and lightning are caused by the movement of electrical charges within a cloud or between a cloud and the ground snow is made up of frozen water vapor while rain is made up of liquid water during a snowstorm the air is typically too cold for the snow to melt and become rain so there is no movement of electrical charges and therefore no thunder or lightning nto understand this better think about the difference between ice and water ice is a solid while water is a liquid if you put ice in a warm room it will eventually melt and become water similarly if the air is warm enough snow will melt and become rain but if the air is cold the snow will stay frozen and there wont be any thunder or lightning,1

a higher annual deductible health insurance plan typically has a lower monthly premium which means that the insured person would pay less each month towards their health insurance this can be a good option for someone who has a limited budget for monthly expenses but who is able to save up enough money to cover a higher deductible if they need to use their health insurancefor example someone who is selfemployed or who has a lowincome job may not have a lot of money available to pay a high monthly premium but they may still be able to save up enough money to cover a higher deductible if they need to use their health insurance in this case a plan with a higher annual deductible and a lower monthly premium might be a more affordable optionits important to keep in mind that while a higher deductible plan may have a lower monthly premium it also means that the insured person will be responsible for paying a larger portion of their healthcare costs out of pocket before their insurance coverage kicks in this means that they may need to pay more out of pocket for healthcare services such as doctors visits and prescription medications until they reach their deductible its important to carefully consider the costs and benefits of different health insurance plans before choosing one that is right for you,1
in theory once a warhead gets into its terminal phase it means its course can not be corrected and therefore would be easier to intercept thaad is designed primarily to shoot down smaller missiles like scuds  which have a short range and thus only a short amount of time to be intercepted  to protect against larger missiles like icbms  the us has other anti  ballistic  missile systems  such as  gmd   url0   these can intercept missiles earlier in their flight path than what thaad can  a few concepts you have to understand about icbmâ´s and nuclear weapons in general a normal missle goes from point a to point b in a direct route  a ballistic missle actually goes up to near space altitudes in direct accend and then decends on to the target from that altitud  this allows you to efficiently fire a missle over large distances efficiently without having to worry about airspaces  structures and also using the curvature of the earth for ease of travel  this makes the missle impossible to intercept on launch becuase its going too fast and its usualy inside the airspace of the country that s launching it  its impossible to intercept during the cruise segment of the flight becuase its in near orbital hights  meaning that the only practical moment in which it can be intercepted would be on decent when its near your airspace allowing you to use shorter range interceptors which are cheaper and easier to deploy  something you also have to take in to account is that nuclear weapons require a detonation circuit which is independent to the impact  a normal high explosive warhead unless programed with a secundary detonator will explode on impact or will only require a simple electrical spark to detonate the explosive  a nuclear warhead requires a complex set of explosive plates to implode the fissionable material or a neutron trigger to start the fussion process as well as a configured set of neutron reflectors to provide maximum fissionable efficiency  meaning you ca nt detonate a nuclear warhead by just giving it a zap or a spark  so if you explode it the entire detonator configuration is damaged and it will be hard to detonate it  unfortunatly this was corrected with mirv technology  mirv is multiple independent reentry vehicle  the idea is that to destroy a specific target like a millitary base  or a city with a 3  4 mile radius you do nt need a 50 megaton warhead  you can do it with a 1 or half megaton warhead  so if you remove a large warhead from a icbm and replace ith with several smaller ones  first of all the damage and fallout will be more controlled considering a ground war would probobly follow the first phase nuclear war  but also a single warhead that splits in to 3  12 smaller warheads is much harder to stop with a system like thaad  it would probobly be more efficient to use a system like the israeli iron dome to stop the smaller warheads  the idea is that the main icbm launches and reaches the sub orbital or orbital cruise phase and then manuvers to launch multiple smaller on the target with multiple reentry vehicles  tldr  its too difficult to intercept an icbm over enemy airspace and its unreachable in its sub orbital cruise phase  so reentry is the only point where its actualy reachable by your interception methods ,0
its complicated but heres a simple explanationnnthe united states has a long history of working with saudi arabia especially when it comes to things like buying oil and fighting terrorism because of this the united states is hesitant to say or do things that might upset saudi arabia or cause problems in the relationship between the two countriesnnin addition saudi arabia is a very powerful and influential country in the middle east and the united states may be worried about what would happen if the relationship between the two countries became worsennfinally the united states may not want to appear to be telling other countries how to run their own affairs especially when it comes to things like human rights this is because the united states values the idea of sovereignty which means that each country should be able to govern itself without interference from other countriesnnoverall while the united states does raise concerns about human rights in saudi arabia it is often cautious about applying too much pressure especially if it could lead to problems in the relationship between the two countries,1
mostly ditto to dillip sarwate let me just add i dont know how youre making your payments whether through the billers web site your banks web site by mail in person etc but whatever the mechanism if there is a chance that waiting until the due date to pay may mean that you will miss the due date dont the cost of a late payment charge is likely to far exceed any interest you would collect on your savings bear in mind that we are talking pennies here i dont know how much the monthly bills that we are discussing here come to say its 3000 i think that would be a lot for most people you say youre getting 36 on your savings so if on the average you pay a bill 2 weeks later than you might have youre getting an extra 2  52 x 36 x 3000 in interest or 4 per month i think the last time i paid a late fee on a credit card it was 35 so if you make one mistake every 8 months and end up getting a late fee it will outweigh any savings  personally i pay most of my bills through either my banks web site or the billers web site i schedule all payments when i get a paycheck and i generally try to schedule them for 1 week before the due date so theres plenty of breathing room,0
does it happen often  no  in fact i ca nt find a case where such a suit actually went to trial   does the president actually have to go to court  maybe  depends  you can not sue the president directly for on  the  job actions  you can sue the federal government  as an entity  in which case the government would have a defense attorney represent the government  the president would nt appear  you  can  sue the president directly for off  the  job actions  as has happened to clinton and jfk  but they both settled out of court   what s the process  the same process for anyone suing anybody else  the president gets sued a lot by different groups and congressmen  senstors including just recently the aclu  the president does not go to these courts but instead employs the us justice dept that act as representatives for the president and other high ranking officials  secretary of state for example   most of the issues deal with executive orders and administrative actions since it is not allowed to sue the president for a political decision as opposed to an administrative decision  you can google the pdf of the aclu suit and see the top left where is states  the president of the united states  as defendant  there are rules governing the inclusion of all defendants for the purposes of equal justice and rules regarding frivolous suits that can get you dis  barred as a lawyer  fined  held in contempt or thrown in prison  last one unlikely   if you would like i can try to dig up some cases on westlaw but it may not happen today  i got an appellate brief due soon  source law student it happens every now and again  in general  the president has absolute immunity from being sued for civil damages for their official acts  as established in  nixon v fitzgerald   this is limited in several ways  first  they are not immune for criminal charges  though as far as i know any prosecution has to come from impeachment in the house followed by conviction in the senate  second  they are not immune from being sued for things done before taking office   clinton v jones    third  and most relevant right now  they can be sued in their official capacity for actions which violate established law  including common law and the constitution  this is the basis for  aziz v trump    darweesh v trump    cair v trump   etc  if you read the petitions initiating the suits you ll see they state   v donald j trump in his official capacity as president of the united states  or similar  the president does nt have to go to court  depending on the court and how important or how far along the case is  they d be represented  if for something done in their official capacity  by a us attorney  the solicitor general  the attorney general  or similar  if in their individual capacity  as in for things before taking office  they d have to hire their own counsel  as far as i m aware ,0

an ac motor is a type of electric motor that uses alternating current ac to convert electrical energy into mechanical energy ac motors have a rotor and a stator which are the moving and stationary parts of the motor respectivelynnthe stator is the outer part of the motor that surrounds the rotor and is typically made of a series of electromagnets when an electric current is applied to the stator it creates a magnetic field that rotates around the rotornnthe rotor is the inner part of the motor that is attached to a shaft and is made of a series of conductors such as copper wire as the magnetic field rotates around the rotor it causes the rotor to turn as wellnnac motors can be singlephase or threephase singlephase ac motors are used for small appliances and tools while threephase ac motors are used for larger applications such as pumps fans and conveyor beltsnnthreephase ac motors have three sets of stator windings that are evenly spaced around the circumference of the stator when an electric current is applied to each set of windings it creates three separate rotating magnetic fields these magnetic fields work together to cause the rotor to turn smoothly and efficientlynni hope this helps to explain how an ac motor works let me know if you have any other questions,1

the economy can grow in the short term by increasing the production of goods and services but in the long term the economy can only continue to grow if we find ways to use resources more efficiently and discover new resources to replace those that are running out its a bit like when you want to grow taller you can eat more food to help your body grow for a little while but eventually you will stop growing because your body has reached its full size in the same way the economy cant keep growing forever because there are limits to how many resources we have available however we can try to use our resources wisely and find new ways to produce things so that we can continue to have a strong economy,1

eyes  and the parts of the brain that support them  are  really expensive  for an organism to grow and operate  having an eye is very advantageous  and having two of them is almost twice as good  the value of more eyes is nt as obvious an advantage  though  when there are so many better things you can do with that metabolic energy besides driving the computing power to decode the extra input  one eye gets you vision  a second eye adds depth perception  improved motion tracking  lifesaving redundancy  and expanded peripheral coverage  nature has ruled that in most cases  having more eyes than that does nt impart a reproductive advantage  great answers  but i guess the follow  up question might be  why do so many insects  and arachnids and penguins  have more than two eyes  is it proportionally less metabolically expensive for creatures of miniscule body weight or does the advantage have something to do with being small and or fast  going from one eye to two provides   greatly improved redundancy  greatly improved depth perception  improved field of vision going from two to three gets you   somewhat improved redundancy  slightly improved depth perception  somewhat improved field of vision eyes are expensive  but going from one to two has a big payoff  going from two to three costs just as much  but has a much smaller payoff ,0
why should i change  you should nt if you do nt feel a need to  here s my take on why valve is going the steamos route  and also what possible benefits you may have   microsoft may start making windows more closed and restrictive  they ve already launched their own equivalent  app store  for windows desktop  that potential restrictiveness is a threat to valve s business model with steam   they want more games to run on linux because they are launching their own console that uses a linux based operating system   this opens up more marketshare as now linux users can buy games on steam  albeit a very small market share    how can it help games perform better  this is more of a technical answer  your operating system is what controls a program s use of your computer  so when you open up a video game on steam for windows  it talks directly with windows to acquire resources  windows then decides how much resources your video game receives  the thing is  windows is a generic all purpose operating system  it s designed to allow a user to run multiple applications at the same time  as well as a wide variety of different applications that have different uses  an analogy would be to compare it to a mini  van  it has plenty of space  can get you around  and is all  purpose enough to go grocery shopping  take the family camping  or transport furniture around town  now  video games are a very specific type of application that have very specific needs  and if you run an operating system that is custom tailored to those needs  you will get better performance  so valve building steamos allows them to do this  valve does nt want a minivan  it wants an f1 race car  a car that is designed specifically to do one thing  and one thing really well  so i wo nt be surprised if one day steamos will allow games to run with superior performance instead of on windows  i started making breakfast sandwiches  i have always loved them but thought they were a pain in the ass and a mess to clean up  till i figured out a way that uses less dishes and only takes about ten minutes  i make patties out of the bob evans sausage in a tube and put them on the grill on high  after that s on i put an egg for every sandwhich in a buttered pan  i then start toasting english muffins  bu the time the english muffins are done  the eggs are about done  and the sausage is done a minute or two later  throw some cheese on there and that shit is good  has totally changed my morning since i started doing it  may not be the best thing for you  but itactually feels like a real breakfast and uses a total of one pan and two forks  well a lot is still not known about steamos  but as far as gaming quality goes steamos should be able to focus completely on gaming and ignore a lot of overhead windows has  from my understanding it is nt a replacement for windows  instead it focuses high performance gaming ,0

dog poop turns white after it has been sitting outside for a long time because it is decomposing or breaking down when poop decomposes it loses its color and starts to look white this happens because the bacteria in the poop are breaking down the organic matter like food inside the poop and as they do this they release gases that can make the poop look fluffy or fuzzy when the poop is freshly made it is usually brown because it contains a pigment called bilirubin which is produced by the liver and gives poop its color but as the poop decomposes the bacteria in the poop break down the bilirubin and thats why the poop starts to look white,1

tesla cars are special because they are electric cars which means they run on electricity rather than gasoline this makes them better for the environment because they do not produce pollution like gas cars do they are also very fast and have a lot of hightech features which makes them fun to drive they are not more mainstream yet because they are still very expensive and not everyone can afford to buy one but as more people start using electric cars and the technology gets better and cheaper it is possible that tesla cars will become more popular and more people will be able to afford them,1

monsanto as a whole is just another large corporation  however  their practices are what draw a lot of  probably  warranted ire  one prominent example of the products they sell is seeds  they spent a lot of money into genetically modifying plants in order to do various things  some of those things include building an immunity to a weed killer  that they sell  so that the chemical can be sprayed on the crops liberally without care  and things like  terminator  genes where the seed will sprout and grow but is rendered sterile by the genes  meaning the farmers that use the seed have to rebuy seed every year instead of being able to use seeds from the harvest   what s particularly notable though  is that they managed to get a patent on specific genes  more or less   it s kind of a crazy concept  on one hand they claim to just want to protect their r  d and intellectual property  on the other hand  it s arguable that this sort of precedent creates all kinds of future issues on the nature of patenting dna sequences  however  it goes further  they re known to aggressively pursue litigation against farmers they suspect of having their products without paying for them  their tactics are reportedly underhanded and plain bully  ish  even if a case is overruled or dropped  the defendant has to spend considerable amounts of money defending themselves   this is my biased opinion here  they really give off the super  big  corporation  that  acts  shady vibe  corporate interests  greed  trumping everything else  shady ways of handling things  etc  their wikipedia entry has a full section dedicated to the controversies they re involved in and you might want to check out the documentary the future of food  it s definitely biased but it s still decent   edit  grammar corrections   monsanto genetically modifies corn   bees take pollen from the modified corn  and spread it on other people s corn   the pollen contains  terminator genes   these genes supposedly make the pollen unable to pollinate other people s corn   the terminator genes do nt work  so the pollen  does  pollinate other people s corn   other people harvest their own corn  and keep some as seed for next year  they do nt realize this seed now contains monsanto genes   monsanto then accuses the other people of  stealing  their genetically modified corn   monsanto wins in court  and extracts huge fines from these farmers   edit  commenters below are correct  corn is not bee  pollinated  as it turns out  the court case in question  monsanto vs schmeiser  involved canola  not corn  commenters are also correct that the terminator genes were never used  monsanto did win the court case  the case involved one more detail that i omitted  schmeiser was running a canola  breeding operation  and schmeiser ended up selecting for the monsanto genes  the court noted that it did nt matter whether this was deliberate or not  since in a patent infringement case  deliberateness does nt change the outcome  in addition to hooj s excellent answer  if you re a farmer who does nt do business with monsanto  but your fields are next to a farmer s who does have monsanto crops  there will inevitably be some cross  pollination  this happens all the time in farmer s fields   so  even though you never interacted with monsanto  and did nt do anything  some pollen got to your crops  so monsanto wants you to pay for crops pollinated by plants they modified  since they re a giant corp  they can afford to sue small farmers that ca nt fight back  and have done so  people think they re scummy because those farmers did nt have anything to do  and did nt want anything to do  with monsanto  until they got sued ,0

people with a stutter also known as stuttering may have difficulty speaking smoothly and fluently when they are speaking naturally but they may be able to sing more fluently because singing involves a different set of muscles and processes in the brain than speaking doesnnwhen we speak we use the muscles in our mouth tongue and throat to produce sounds and form words stuttering can occur when there is a problem with the coordination or control of these muscles which can cause disruptions in the flow of speechnnsinging on the other hand involves using the muscles in our diaphragm chest and stomach to produce sound as well as the muscles in our mouth tongue and throat to shape the sound into words and melodies these muscles may work differently than the muscles used for speaking which can make it easier for someone with a stutter to sing more fluentlynnits also possible that the rhythm and structure of singing may help someone with a stutter to speak more fluently as the regular beat and melody of a song can provide a framework for producing sound and words however this is not always the case as stuttering can affect different people in different ways,1

it is a common misconception that intelligent people are more likely to be depressed in fact there is no scientific evidence to support the idea that intelligence is linked to depression however it is possible that intelligent people may be more prone to certain risk factors for depression such as high levels of stress or perfectionism it is also possible that intelligent people may be more likely to seek help for their depression which could lead to the mistaken belief that they are more prone to the disorder ultimately it is important to remember that depression can affect anyone regardless of their intelligence or other personal characteristics,1
the size of your down payment on a mortgage can have a significant impact on the terms of your mortgage loan and the overall cost of your home a down payment is the amount of money that you pay upfront towards the purchase of your hometraditionally lenders have required buyers to make a down payment of at least 20 of the purchase price of the home in order to qualify for a mortgage this is because a down payment of 20 or more allows you to avoid paying private mortgage insurance pmi which is an insurance policy that protects the lender in case you default on your mortgagehowever it is possible to obtain a mortgage with a down payment of less than 20 many lenders offer mortgage products with as little as a 3 down payment for qualified buyers while a smaller down payment can make it easier to afford a home it also typically results in a higher monthly mortgage payment and may require you to pay pmiultimately the size of your down payment should be based on your financial situation and your goals if you have a high credit score and a stable income you may be able to qualify for a mortgage with a smaller down payment however if you have a lower credit score or are unable to save for a down payment you may need to consider alternative options such as a governmentbacked loan program or a coborrower its important to carefully consider your options and make a decision that is right for your financial situation,1

im not intimately familiar with the situation in australia but in the us the powers that be have adopted an interventionist philosophy the federal reserve central bank is buying back us govt debt to keep rates low and the government is keeping mortgage rates low buy buying mortgages with the proceeds of the cheap bond sales while this isnt directly related to australia it is relevant because the largest capital markets are in the us and influence the markets in australia in the us the cpi is a survey of all urban consumers if youre a younger middle class consumer with income growth ahead of you your costs are going to shift more rapidly than an elderly or poor person who already owns or is in subsidized housing and doesnt spend as much on transportation for example my parents are in their early 60s and are living in the house that i grew up in which they own free and clear there are alot of people like them and they arent affected by the swing in housing prices that weve seen in the last decade,0

reporters can  commercials and entertainment shows ca nt without licensing it  most brands want you to use their brand name  and so they are very open about how they let people use it  the nfl though makes a ton of money by licensing the name super bowl only to specific companies so they can be the  official whatchamathing of the super bowl   as such the nfl is very strict on who uses it for what  you can not say super bowl if you are advertising a product unless you have an agreement with the nfl  normal people can say super bowl  the news can talk about the super bowl  a bar however can not say  watch the super bowl here   since they are using the nfl s product to advertise you coming to their bar ,0
this program seems to use a method called binary search  essentially it has a big table of millions of characters  each with various characteristics  with each question  the goal is to eliminate the most potential candidates possible  in which case the best strategy is to ask a question that can split the remaining group in half  here is an example  let s assume i want to find where you live with only yes  no questions  first i would ask  do you live in the north hemisphere  if yes  i would ask  do you live in china  india  if no i would ask  do you live in north america or western europe  if yes i would ask do you live in north america  if yes i would ask  do you live west of missouri  if yes i would ask  do you live south of oregan  if yes i would say do you live in california  so on and so on  using this same division of remaining possibilities  you can specify further and further  imagine this same strategy applied to every person on earth  if you could actually split the group in half each time  it would only take 33 questions to get from 7 billion possible people down to one individual  there s a general explanation in the  wikipedia article about the 20q toy   url1   but if you want more detail you can also look at  the patent   url0   good coding  learning and many  many people answering  it s simple as that  it s just algorithm looking for patterns  especially based on previous questions ,0
snow is actually a type of ice  the difference is shape  on a really tiny level  snow is a bunch of flakes  they have a complex shape  with a lot of air in it  these flakes do nt stack very neatly  imagine trying to fill a bag with aluminum cans  when you simply toss them in  the bag fills up quite quickly and is very light  if you were to crush those cans first  you break their shape to get rid of extra air and fit them together better  this is like when you walk in the snow and pack it down  if you were to melt all those cans together into a brick first  you d have no air in it  and you d be able to fit a lot more cans in a bag  and that s like  ice  snow  fluffy  air  filled ice indeed  both frozen water  but different forms  kind of like the difference between rocks and sand  to elaborate a bit more on the other posts  snow is ice  just like how origami is paper  snow is ice forming high in the atmosphere where it allows water crystals  ice  to spread out in all directions  snow forms into flakes with 6 degrees of symmetry due to the physical properties of the water molecule  although the flakes are symmetrical  they are also very random as there are billions and billions of directions in which the water crystals can grow  that is where you get the phrase  people are like snowflakes  no two are the same  or something like that  in another post on here  someone described compacted snow as  ice   this would be better described as a glacier  all of these things are made of ice  think of ice as paper  snow as the origami  and glaciers as hundreds of crunched together origamis  also  it is worth noting that snow needs dust particles to begin development  these particles can be  extremely  small  but  for an ice crystal to begin forming a snowflake  it needs something to grow off of  otherwise  it is like trying to plant a flower seed without any soil  probably a bit too much for a 5 year old  and probably not all that insightful  but i tried my best for 5am ,0
there are several factors that doctors consider when deciding which type of scan to use these include n1 the part of the body being examined different types of scans are better suited for examining different parts of the body for example mri is often used to examine the brain and spinal cord while xrays are often used to examine bones n2 the type of information needed different types of scans can provide different types of information for example mri can provide detailed images of soft tissues while ct scans can provide detailed images of both soft tissues and bones n3 the patients condition some types of scans may not be suitable for certain patients such as those who have pacemakers or are pregnant n4 the availability of the equipment not all hospitals or clinics have all types of scanners so the availability of the equipment may also play a role in the decision n5 the cost some types of scans may be more expensive than others and this may also be a factor in the decision noverall doctors consider all of these factors when deciding which type of scan to use in order to get the best possible images and information for the patients specific condition,1
they re finding the one good review and pulling quotes from that  whenever you see a quote from a reviewer in a tv commercial  you should always look closely to see where the quote comes from  if it s not from a well  regarded publication  it s pretty safe to assume the movie s gon na be bad  also a reviewer could say transformers has  epic visuals  but then shit on the rest of the movie  but the commercial will just pull the word  epic  and go with that  actual review  this piece of crap was an epic failure on every level  i now must see a psychiatrist to forget how awful it was   movie poster  epic  on every level    must see   movie reviewers for news papers and magazines get paid to review movies  people buy those papers and magazines for the reviews of upcoming films  but the film reviewers are chosen by the studio s to get early access to the film to review them before the general public  so if the reviewers go and say that studio x s latest blockbuster is a snore fest  that studio is less likely to invite them to the next early screening  if the reviewer can not get into early screenings any more they are less likely to be hired by magazines to review movies  thus reviewers get creative with their reviews or just flat out lie  and even when they do give bad reviews the studios can pull stunts like this url0 the review between their heads from the guardian  is actually a 2 star review  but careful positioning gives the impression that it is just cut off by the picture and is actually a 4 star like the ones around it ,0
double jeopardy is a principle in the law that prevents a person from being tried for the same crime twice this means that if a person has already been found innocent of a crime they cannot be charged and tried for that same crime againnnhowever if a person who has been found innocent later confesses to the crime it is possible for them to be charged with a new crime for lying under oath or for making a false statement this is because lying under oath or making a false statement is a separate crime from the original crime that the person was found innocent ofnnso if a person who was found innocent later confesses to the crime they could potentially be charged with a new crime for lying or making a false statement however they would not be able to be tried again for the original crime that they were found innocent of,1
basic universal income and unconditional welfare are similar in that they are both programs that provide people with financial assistance however there are some key differences between the twornrnunconditional welfare is a program that provides financial assistance to people who are in need this assistance is typically given to people who are unable to work due to illness disability or other circumstances the amount of assistance that people receive is usually based on their need and is intended to help them meet their basic needs such as food shelter and medical carernrnbasic universal income on the other hand is a program that provides a regular unconditional payment to everyone in a community or country regardless of their income or employment status the idea behind basic universal income is to provide a safety net for everyone so that everyone has enough money to meet their basic needsrnrnso in short both programs provide financial assistance to people but unconditional welfare is targeted at people who are in need while basic universal income is provided to everyone,1
helloacid reflux or exercise can increase increase heart rate slightly but 155 persisting for 7 hours is less likely this can be a cardiac arrhythmia like psvt or atrial fibrillation in which heart rate suddenly goes up blood pressure may fall during these episodes and one has dizziness fainting blackouts sometimes syncope usually ecg is normal as it is usually done in between the episodes ecg done during episodes will show abnormality you will need 24 hour holter monitoring or get ecg done during high heart rate also hemoglobin and thyroid test should be done ln order to abort such episodes you should try to cough hard is there any stress or anxiety associated    till the time your evaluation is complete you can ask your local doctor for tab ciplar la 20 mg once a day     if none of the above is successful then last option is of electrophysiological studies which is invasive test which can diagnose and treat the arrhythmia permanently in most of the cases hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts,0
market capitalization or market cap is a measure of the value of a publicly traded company it is calculated by multiplying the companys stock price by the number of shares outstanding for example if a companys stock is trading at 50 per share and there are 1 million shares outstanding the companys market cap would be 50 millionmarket cap is often used as an indicator of a companys size and it is a key factor in determining the value of a companys stock it is also used as a measure of the overall size of a stock market or an economy for example the total market cap of all publicly traded companies in a country may be used as a measure of the size of that countrys economyits important to note that market cap is not the same thing as the value of a companys assets or the amount of money it generates in revenue it is simply a measure of the value that investors have placed on the company based on its stock price,1
obama did nt order it to be shut down  he promised that he would while he was campaigning  but he never followed through  the reason that he never followed through is that obama is hitler it s really hard to actually figure out what to do with the people who are incarcerated there  you ca nt just let them all go  and no one is willing to take them  so for now they re stuck in limbo  until we can figure out where to put them  they re stuck  obama ordered it to be shut down at his first inaugural  however congressional action restricted the transfer of prisoners to american prisons  robert gates stated that the lack of congressional consensus on a plan of action for the detainees in guantanamo hampers any conceivable executive solution  the gitmo prison has not been shutdown becuase there are prisoners that can not be transferred to the continental us and no one else will take them  we do nt want to release them  they have not been tried or moved because the us has not adapted its judiciary system to the reality of running a worldwide policing force that slaps the crap out of yuh for wearing odd rags  it has no reason to make that adaptation because no one is forcefully asking them to and the fear of extrajudicial rendition into a torture quagmire causes lots to shake in their boots  the guantanamo bay inmates are not prisoners of the us they were captured by the widespread tentacular arms of the global power that the us exerts all over  we ca nt put them into the us because that would allow lawyers to represent them in regular us courts  like in downtown akron  ohio or whatever jurisdiction they fell under  all this   there s no funds to close the place  is a jungle of confusion over the real issue  the us spawned a new phase of global interest  that force captured prisoners  it has no  country  to put them in so they re stuck in some type of limbo off in cuba ,0
linux is like play dough  not play  doh  because its home made in a sense  anyone can use the linux software recipes for free  but sometimes that s a bit of work  some people say that s part of the fun  in other words  it means it is the user community that is generating software for itself  there are some companies charging for linux software  but mostly linux is unattractive to them  because someone will just make a free version  how various pieces of software work in linux is wide open  secret software recipes are frowned upon  this is called  open source  or  free software   windows is more like lego  buying software is like buying kits of parts  and everything fits together great  many other companies make windows software that you can buy  that usually works very well  but occasionally can have small problems  in fact  anyone can make their own windows software  similar to linux  but it has to interface with windows and microsoft can be very secretive about how their system works  whether this is good or bad depends on who you ask  windows is called closed source  proprietary or commercial software  purchased software is too  mac os is more like an action figure or doll  someone apple went to great trouble to design the software and hardware just the way they think is best  all the accessories are company approved  so they fit correctly  other people can make things for os x  but they sometimes must seek apple s permission  and they have to follow apple s strict guidelines  apple is also closed source  they are secretive about the inner workings  if you read that in another sense  it shows that linux software is very flexible  but it can be floppy  sloppy and messy  but not all of it is  some of it is great  windows software is tailored to certain ideas about how things should click together  microsoft does nt care  what  you make with it  just as long as you do nt try to change how parts interact  you can buy completed kits  or follow your whims  apple software is created so that the user gets a certain experience  it can be rigid and perhaps limitedsome would say   but that means it works very consistently  however  in all the operating systems  many people use some open source software  particularly web browsers like firefox or chrome  maybe you do too  i m a linux user  i hope i was nt biased  windows  pros almost all programs work on it  it is easy enough to get working  many companies and school make you use it   so it is good to know how to use  many other people use it   cons because so many people use it  mean people write viruses for it  it is nt very fast and uses quite a bit of memory mac osx  pros easy to use  clean user interface  because few people use it  there are not as many viruses   though this is changing    cons not all programs work on it  very expensive  because you have to buy a computer that comes with it  linux  pros very fast and light weight  programs are extremely easy to install if you know how to use the command line  if you are a programmer  getting up and running is extremely fast  linux is used by companies like google and facebook to keep their websites running  so it has to be extremely secure  no viruses  you look like a badass fast loading speeds   cons can be very hard to use if you are nt already good at using it   catch 22  it is very easy to break if you do nt know what you are doing  it is very easy to break even if you know what you are doing  very little software  that you would probably know and use  is supported  there are ways around this  but it is fairly hard  you re going to get a lot of subjective responses to this  but most of the decision comes down to personal preference  i will try to not include any bias in my response    pros   windows  most popular  largest amount of available software mac os  since the manufacturer of the os also manufactures the hardware which it runs on it tends to run the smoothest  inexpensive compared to windows  less prone to viruses and malware than windows  lots of included software direct from the manufacturer linux  free  less prone to viruses and malware  ability to install on almost any machine  you have the most control over the machine with a linux os   cons   windows  expensive compared to other options  prone to viruses and malware  relatively insecure compared to alternatives  lots of different versions that offer different features mac os  can only run on apple hardware  not as much available software as compared to windows  third party pc add ons can have compatibility issues due to lack of support  not as wide a user base linux  huge learning curve if you come from using windows or mac  many various linux variations to choose from  can be very confusing and difficult to set up and maintain there are many more pros and cons for each  these are just a few that came to mind right away  for the record  i use all three on a daily basis ,0
it could be a few things  you hear about how things that are like being in the womb are comforting  and a car seat holds and cradles them similarly  it could be the slight vibration of the car  my son really like white noise  and the engine could be providing that with yours  it s dark in the car  and the temperature is usually pleasant  too  i actually  think  this is a pavlovian  conditioned  response mixed with a few other things  once the kid is strapped down they ca nt really move around much and they are somewhat forced to relax  they have been repeatedly put in that comfortable  and boring  seat for extended periods of times  and have fallen asleep there more than once  thinking about a 15 month old who is fussy and exhausted  being  forced  to relax in a chair they have fallen asleep in a hundred times would do it  is it just me or have the average eli5 queries gotten much lamer since the sub became a default subscription  i ca nt imagine a definitive answer to this question   what s up with that  ,0
just think of the odometer in your car  when you buy a new car  it reads 0000  you drive one kilometer  or mile  wherever you are  and now it reads 0001  keep driving and the odometer will do this  0000 0001 0002 0003 0004 0005 0006 0007 0008 0009 but what happens when you drive that tenth kilometer  the rightmost digit ca nt increase anymore  because it s already at 9  which is as high as our numbers go  so  that one goes back to 0 and the one to the left of it goes up by one  0010 this is how you  me  and everyone learned how to count  there are ten digits to work with  0 through 9  but now imagine how an odometer would work if you only had two digits to work with  0 and 1  instead of 0  9  0000  brand new car  0001  i ve driven my first kilometer  what happens now  we want to increase the rightmost digit  but it s already as high as it can go  so  exactly as in the first example  we reset that one to 0 and increase the one to the left of it  0010  this looks like  ten  but it s actually two  and now you know how to count in binary  0000  zero  0001  one  0010  two  0011  three  0100  four  0101  five  0110  six  0111  seven  1000  eight  and so on  binary is actually incredibly simple  in base10  what we use every day   the as you move up the places  the place values increase by a power of 10  eg  100 10 1 hundreds tens units in binary  instead of place values increasing by powers of ten  they increase by powers of two  so the place numbers are instead  128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1 so  for example  the number 69 does nt need any 128s  it needs a 64  so the most significant bit is going to be 1  now we need to get 5  64  569   so we need a 4 and 1  but we do nt need 32  16  8  or 2  so we put a zero in their places  so the final binary number is  1000101   or 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 64 4 1  there are 10 types of people in the world  those who understand binary  and those who do nt ,0

when a spacecraft thruster is fired it pushes against the gas or other matter that is being expelled from it this is similar to how a rocket works  the rockets engine burns fuel and expels hot gases out of the back and it is the momentum of these gases that propels the rocket forward in the case of a spacecraft thruster the gas being expelled can be a variety of substances such as cold water nitrogen or even just plain old air so to summarize when a spacecraft thruster is fired it creates a small amount of gas or matter and it is the movement of this gas or matter that allows the spacecraft to adjust its position it works a bit like when you blow up a balloon and let it go  the air rushing out of the balloon pushes the balloon in the opposite direction,1
some of it is natural pride  we believe  pretty reasonably i think  that our military is the best in the world  that we could kick anyone s ass in a conventional war if it came to it  we have the same pride about our abilities in basketball and competitive eating  some of it is guilt after vietnam  after wwi and wwii  we greeted returning soldiers as heroes  after vietnam  not so much  people in favor of the war were disappointed we lost  people against the war saw the soldiers as symbols of what was a bad idea to begin with  in subsequent wars  everyone s been very careful to show gratitude to the military  whether or not they support the cause the soldiers are fighting for  some of it is nationalism  we have a strongly nationalist culture  we take the flag and the national anthem and the pledge of allegiance seriously  many people believe it should be illegal to burn an american flag in protest  even though we consider freedom of expression to be one of our most sacred rights  some of it is propaganda  which you could argue our nationalism is a result of propaganda  but that s for another question   after 911  a lot of criticisms about our military actions were deflected by arguing that we have to support our troops  it was pushed over and over again  so that we were having conversations about supporting troops instead of whether the war was going well  or if we should have been there in the first place  or whatever  and some of it is familial  we have been in a lot of wars and other military actions in the past 100 years or so  just about everyone who is nt an immigrant has combat veterans in their family  most american pride is aimed at the soldiers  not the military  other countries do not have to maintain their armies the way the us does because the us maintains its army in the manner we do and act as the world police  we have also been the victors in both world wars and so nationalism has only been a benefit to us ,0
getting electronics wet causes a short circuit  basically  circuits are set up so that electricity can only flow in certain  predictable paths  water creates bridges that are nt supposed to be there  letting the electricity flow in ways it s not supposed to  and that can cause damage  on the other hand  distilled water wo nt damage your electronics until enough pollutants get into the water to create the electric pathways for it to short circuit  you can dip a unplgged mother board into distilled water and let it dry  it ll be fine  worked in a mobile phone repair centre for a fair while  we repaired  cleaned water damaged phones on a daily basis  there s basically two causes of damage  1  when the phone first gets wet  the water can short out the circuit  this can cause damage  but ussually phones are low power and so ca nt really damage themselves with a short circuit  it s possible  but not that common  this sort of damage we did nt really bother to  repair   we just randomly replaced components until it works again then bill the customer for all the parts  2  after the water dries out  leave phone in rice overnight trick   the phone will most likely work again  however the water drying up leaves behind whatever chemicals were in the water on the metals used in the circuits  left unchcecked  this will eventually lead to corrosion  corroded metals do nt conduct electricity properly or can break a connection entirely  this will stop your phone working  this is why a water damaged phone can start working again the next day but then eventually a few weeks  months later stop working properly and eventually degrade to the point it no longer works at all  this is the corrosion slowly breaking your phone  we repair this sort of damage by resoldering the connections that look corroded  broken and hoping for the best  if this does nt work we just tell you your phone is fucked and sell you a new one  to repair water damaged phones that still worked  we would take all the components out  scrub the pcbs and all the connections with a solvent and a tooth brush to effectively wash them out  then dry them and put them back together  getting this done within a week or two of the water damage generally guarantees no lasting impact on your phone  however since the phone often starts working again after the original water damage  people often figure it s fine and do nt bother with any repair work while corrosion slowly eats their phone from the inside  most phones i ever saw that were no longer working  had some level of corrosion on the circuit components  simply cleaning the corrosion off with solvent and a toothbrush fixed a surprising amount of them ,0
anal sex  really that is the main difference  anal sex between a man and a woman is about as dangerous as far as hiv is concerned as anal sex between a man and another man  a human vagina has all sorts of features for making penetration easier that your average anus lacks  you are more likely to end up with raw and broken skin that way and hiv is transmitted by blood  the odds of getting infected are asymmetric for both vaginal and anal sex  the fuckee is more likely to end up fucked than the fucker   nbsp    edited to add some numbers and source  according to the  cdc   url2  and some studies from the lance cited on  url0   url1  risk per exposure  type of sex  fucker  fuckee   vaginal 004 008  anal  011   138  gay  men  are at higher risk  largely because anal sex is an effective method of transmission for hiv  it s also a bit of a feedback from the very early days of hiv  when the virus spread quickly through the gay community  and a few others at high risk for it   since gay men are more likely to have it  their partners  also gay men  are more likely to get it  and so on   its not like they do anything sexually different than straight people  yes they do  they use protection less often since there is no risk of pregnancy  and they perform more anal sex  which has a higher transmission rate of hiv than straight sex  for a long time aids was known as  grid   gay related immune deficiency  specifically because it was prevalent among gay men ,0
there are many reasons why nations do not always unite to address human rights violations in other countries one reason is that different countries have different interests and priorities and they may not agree on the best way to address a particular issue for example one country may believe that economic sanctions are the most effective way to address human rights violations while another country may believe that military intervention is necessarynnanother reason is that it can be difficult for countries to agree on a plan of action especially if the situation is complex or involves multiple parties for example in the case of north korea there are many different factors at play including the countrys history its relationship with other nations and the actions of its leaders it can be difficult for other countries to agree on the best way to address human rights violations in north korea because they may have different ideas about how to approach the situationnnfinally it is often difficult for countries to act in unity because they may be limited by their own resources or capabilities for example a country may not have the military or economic power to effectively intervene in another country or it may be concerned about the potential costs or risks of such actionnnoverall it is important for countries to work together to address human rights violations but it can be challenging due to the complexity of the issues involved and the different priorities and interests of different nations,1
for one  they have to deal with how it  feels  because it s not like they can line up with a puffy jacket on  however  they often wear more layers of clothing  and the traditional football uniform is pretty heavy as it is  wide receivers normally wear gloves  anyway  too  the people who struggle the most are the quarterbacks  but when it s really cold  they keep handwarmers in that little fanny  pack type thing around their waist  also  i d like to kindly request that the guy who told them to  grow an extra bair of balls  play a night game at lambeau field in january  they warm up before starting  this helps prevent stretching a tendron and similar injuries  too  they also spend very little time standing still  so they keep warm that way  not sure what you mean with fingers  the goalkeepers usually use gloves for a better grip anyway  college football player here in the midwest  you deal with it  long sleeve thick dryfit shirt  long sleeve shirt over the top of that  shoulder pads are good for wind protection  balaclava for the face and ears  we are an fcs football school and we have 4 heaters  have nt needed them yet  some teammates put on like surgical gloves under football gloves to keep finger tips warm  practice we wear sweatshirts and sweatpants over everything ,0

the appeal of facebook used to be a lot greater  you used to not be able to even create an account if you did nt have a college email address  i first got a facebook in probably 2006  2007  somewhere along in there  but i did nt actively use it until other people in my highschool had it  we were close to a college town so everyone could bullshit their way into an account with all of our older friends   which was around 2008  2009  i still used myspace during that time  i m not going to lie  i still log in to myspace every now and then just to see what it s like  i would nt be upset if myspace made a come back  those customizable profile layouts were the best  everyone here is giving some social explanation which are probably valid to a degree  however if i recall correctly  myspace was ravaged by hackers  bots and spam which made the site border line unusable  this happened right around the time fb was starting up  i m sure this helped put the nails in the coffin  i have nt really been keeping up  but i just google searched myspace and it looks like it still gets hacked to this day  this was a huge marketing strategy though i largely disagree with  without most of the features   a lot of the features of myspace only appealed to people that were younger minded  having a profile song  background  top friends  etc  might seem cool to some  but to people that only used it to be able to contact other people  largely useless  moving on though  facebook started with a marketing strategy of making it an exclusive club  first it was  only  harvard  then it was  only  ivy league then it was  only  colleges  then it was  only  colleges and high school and from there it just continued to grow in popularity  plus it trimmed all the other stuff that general myspace users did nt want to deal with  backgrounds  html embed bios  profile songs  top friends   personally i switched because facebook was sleeker and had less  crap   plus more people used it because it had the appeal of  exclusivity   people want what they ca nt have  myspace was nt superior  it was just the first real social platform to take off in a large capacity  it makes sense that someone came along that made a better version and took it to market with a better strategy ,0
in the united states we do have some limitedaccess highways that do not have a specific speed limit these roads are generally known as freeways or interstate highways and they are designed for highspeed travel however most states do have a maximum speed limit that is enforced on these roads typically between 65 and 75 mphrnrnthere are a few reasons why the united states does not have unlimited speed limits on its highways even though some other countries do one reason is that the united states has a much larger population and more vehicle traffic than many other countries which means that there are more potential hazards on the roads high speeds can make it more difficult for drivers to react to changing conditions and can increase the severity of accidentsrnrnanother reason is that the united states has a more diverse geography than many other countries we have a wide range of climates and terrain including mountains deserts and urban areas and different speed limits may be necessary to ensure the safety of drivers in these different environmentsrnrnoverall the goal of setting speed limits is to balance the need for efficient travel with the need to ensure the safety of all road users,1
the people you owe money to get screwed  the court  assuming they agree to your claim of bankruptcy  will gather up all of your assets and sell them off  paying out the proceeds to your debtors  this never ends up being worth it to them  they get pennies on the dollar  if you file for bankruptcy and follow all of the rules  most  if not all of  your personal debts will be  discharged   this means that the creditors can not attempt to collect on the debts  it s like the debt does nt exist anymore  not all debts can be discharged  though  and there are several different types of bankruptcies that you could potentially file  each of which has different rules and requirements for getting a discharge  bankruptcy actually stays on your credit for 10 years not 7unlike other outstanding debts   the answer to your question also depends on whether you file  and are granted  a chapter 7 or chapter 11 bankruptcy  but generally the people you owe get nothing or very little of what you owe them  the longer the bk has been on your credit report the less it affects your chances of being granted credit  you can still have a bank account  you just probably will not be approved for a credit card or loan for a few years  also it should be noted that federal student loans  child support and backed taxes will never be waived in any bk ,0

1  their effect is not  specific  2  a predator fucked up on an acid trip is not in a position to eat you  it s a pretty natural and logical self defence for a prey  plant to develop  just because something has a specific effect on a species  it does nt suggest any sort of evolutionary influence  there are millions upon millions of unique compounds out there  sometimes  they just happen to interact certain receptors we have  for example  microcystin  lr is a cyanotoxin that is 4x as lethal as ricin in mice  it can completely destroy mammalian livers even in small doses  we have no clue what it s actual function is  but it does nt mean cyanobacteria evolved to produce this toxin just to fuck up our livers  most psychoactive plant products we use are  in fact  defense mechanisms  you can drink a cup of coffee and feel nice and alert  but a thousandth of that dose is going to kill a caterpillar almost immediately  the same is true for thc  the main active compound in marijuana   psilocybin and dmt  it is also worth noting that human drug consumption makes these compounds even more favorable  quite a lot of marijuana and magic mushrooms have been grown  solely for recreational reasons  yes i am aware we grow marijuana for industrial reasons also   which is basically  winning the game  when it comes to biology ,0
there are several ways that billionaires and other highincome earners can reduce their tax liability one way is by taking advantage of tax deductions and credits that are available to them for example they may be able to write off certain expenses such as business expenses or charitable donations which can lower their taxable income and therefore their tax bill another way that highincome earners can reduce their tax liability is by investing in assets that appreciate in value such as stocks or real estate when these assets are sold the profit is often taxed at a lower rate than regular income a variable prepaid forward contract is a financial instrument that allows an investor to sell an asset such as stock at a future date for a predetermined price this can be used to lock in profits on the asset and potentially reduce the investors tax liability its important to note that while these strategies can help reduce tax liability they may also be complex and may require the assistance of a financial advisor or tax professional to implement properly,1
its generally not a good idea to try to land in water if your parachute fails or if you are skydiving and your parachute doesnt open properly this is because water is a very hard surface to land on and its easy to get hurt if you hit the water at a high speed its also difficult to swim or float in a parachute so you could end up in a lot of trouble if you land in the waternnif you are skydiving and your parachute doesnt open properly its generally better to try to land in a marsh or swamp or in snow if you are in a cold climate these surfaces are softer and more forgiving than water so you are less likely to get hurt when you land even if you do get hurt it will be easier to get help if you are on land rather than in the waternnso in general its best to try to land on land if you can rather than in the water this will give you the best chance of staying safe and avoiding injury,1

dinosaurs died out about 66 million years ago while many other animals survived one theory is that a large meteor hit the earth and caused a mass extinction event which is when a lot of different species of animals and plants die out at the same time its believed that the meteor impact caused a lot of dust and debris to be sent into the air which blocked out the sunlight and made it hard for plants to grow without plants the animals that ate plants would not have had enough food to survive and many of them would have died at the same time the meteor impact might have caused fires and other changes to the environment which also made it hard for animals to survive in the end only a small number of species were able to adapt to the new conditions and continue living,1
your question is predicated on the fact that america as a whole is religious and europe is nt  that s not correct  while i find it hard to find great numbers  the fact is  the distribution of religious people across both american and europe vary greatly  it s hard to quantify how religious someone is  but you can quantify church attendance  in the us  the south followed by the mid west has the highest weekly church attendance  the west coast and new england have the lowest  in europe  church attendance seems less about geographical lines and more about nationalistic ones  church attendance is high in portugal  poland  and ireland is relatively high  it s low in france  austria  and denmark  now  taken as a whole  church attendance is higher in the us than europe  but  rather than saying why is america so religious compared to europe  you should be asking  why is the south so much more religious than the west coast  or why is ireland so much more religious than england  otherwise  you re comparing two non homogeneous groups to each other which is pretty much impossible   edit  grammar here are the big reasons   the us is huge  and there is a lot of rural population dispersion  this kept people in the us relatively socially isolated throughout history   the us has been a large exporter of culture  and few ideas are imported without being  americanized  to fit already present views   this combination of isolationism and conformity create a generally conservative atmosphere that is generally only resisted in places exposed to international commerce  big cities    the preponderance of american nationalism  patriotism  and conservatism in american culture reinforces internal conformity and prevents ideas from outside the us from taking hold in the daily life of americans  taken together  this means that the us does nt generally do what other countries do  socially speaking   and institutions that can take advantage of these situations  like religion and business  have a strong foothold in american culture  well  the us has  just we  europeans  only hear of the bible bashing rednecks down south  also  the catholic church had that massive priest  child  rape scandal in ireland and other countries which drove massive amounts of people way from it ,0

the argument against term limits has two parts  the first is practical  congresspeople who have been there longer have more experience and  like any field  that makes them likely to be better at the job  the second is more theoretical  basically  the idea is that all elected officials have term limits  because they can always lose  the question is only whether when they leave office should be decided by the voters via the elections  or decided in advance by whoever imposes  approved the term limit  the usual distinctions drawn between congress and the presidency is that the president s term is longer  the president s power  compared to an individual congressperson  is much greater  and the president s advantage from incumbency  in the sense of being able to directly or indirectly use the powers of office to short circuit their opposition  are even greater than that  as such  once the norm of stepping down after two terms was ended with fdr  congress decided it was best to reimpose it  the president once did nt have a term limit until congress decided to make an amendment after fdr served 4 terms  the founding fathers did nt have a limit in the constitution  and washington set the precedent of only two terms  congress would have to pass an amendment and obviously they wo nt pass an amendment that would nt be beneficial to them  you could argue that the entirety of congress has more power  but you can not make that same argument for a single congressperson  i do nt like that some members of congress are there for many decades  but i think two terms would be too short  reality is that of congress comprised completely of people with limited experience would probably not be the best for the public either ,0
no one can really answer this for you  it is a matter of personal preference and the details of your situation  there are some really smart people on here when placed in your exact situation would do completely different things  personal finance is overall personal if it was me id never borrow money in retirement  if i had the cash id use it to help fund the purchase  if i didnt i simply wouldnt  for me wealth retention in your case is surprisingly more about behavior than math even though i am a math guy  you are simply creating a great deal of risk at a season in your life with a diminished ability to recover from negative events  in my opinion you are inviting tales of woe to be part of your future if you borrow others would disagree with me  they would point to the math and show how you would be much better off on borrowing instead of pulling out of investments provided a sufficient return on your nest egg  they may even have a case as you might have to pay taxes on money pulled out magnifying the difference in net income on borrowing versus pulling out in a lump sum  here in the us the money you pulled out would be taxed at the highest marginal rate  to help with a down payment of 50k you might have to pull out 66500 to pay the taxes and have enough for the down payment the third option is to not help with a down payment or to help them in a different way  perhaps giving them a few hundred per month for two years to help with their mortgage payment  maybe watch their kids some to reduce day care costs or help with home improvements so they can buy a lower price home  those are all viable options  perhaps the child is not ready to buy a home having said all that it really depends on your situation  say your sitting on 5 million in investments your pensions is sufficient to have some disposable income and they are asking for a relatively small amount  then pull the money out and dont be concerned  you nest egg will quickly recover the money,0
because the un and it s resolutions are largely toothless  it s an international body with no real authority to make anyone do anything  people  countries will follow along though after someone takes up leadership  so the us as the premiere military and economic power in the world assumes this role  the us has the largest military and the most resources  as far as military  getting actively involved in other nations  biznazz allows the us to maintain posts in other countries  this is usually profitable for both the us and the host country  look at germany   in that the us is able to have a solid foothold and boots on the ground and the host country has an increase in money flowing in and added security from other nations and natural disasters  the us often provides training and equipment for the host nation military as well  improving their ability to field effective troops  the un s four main goals are to promote world peace  develop friendly relations among nations  promote social progress  and better living conditions  the us has the capability deploy military and resources as needed  much more so than the majority of other nations  the us s actions ideally are beneficial to all of the above  i d also like to believe that the un serves as a kind of power check for the us  no single country can stand against the us  but countries can band together to see to their needs  the quality of life part of the un s goals is a large part  much of what the un does is attempt to improve and standardize medical  food  and environmental practices while also pushing for gender equality  nuclear disarmament  human rights  and refugee assistance  they do more stuff  but i m not all that well versed in the un  most of this is conjecture  shit i heard before  with some bits taken from url0 truth be told the us is the world s only superpower at present  especially militarily and economically  projections estimate it ll remain that way for 15  20 years until we are seriously challenged  like it or not the un is a pawn of the us not the other way around  anything we can get them to do for us militarily or economically is costs we do nt have to partake in ourselves  for the most part  especially with the economic departments of the un decision making is proportional to the level of financial commitment  if we provide 51   a majority  of the funding we have a say in 100  of where the dollars go ,0
national borders are the lines that separate one country from another there are different ways that countries can define their national borders one way is through treaties a treaty is a formal agreement between two or more countries in the treaty the countries agree on where the border between them will be for example the united states and canada have a treaty that defines the border between their two countries another way that countries can define their national borders is by simply claiming a piece of land as their own this can happen when there is no other country around to dispute the claim however if there is another country nearby that also wants to claim the same land there may be a conflict in these cases the countries might have to negotiate and come to an agreement on where the border should be in some cases the border between two countries is determined by natural features like rivers or mountain ranges these natural features can make it easy to see where one country ends and another begins i hope that helps do you have any other questions about national borders,1
if a person goes to the hospital because they are feeling suicidal the hospital staff will try to help them feel safe and get the treatment they need this may include talking to a therapist or counselor taking medicine to help with feelings of sadness or hopelessness and having someone stay with the person to make sure they are safe the hospital may also give the person a plan to follow to stay safe such as calling a friend or family member if they start feeling suicidal again or going to a support group the goal is to help the person feel better and to prevent them from attempting suicide again in the future,1
batteries generate power  and in doing so  the chemical energy stored in them is consumed  magnets are not a source of power  just like a rock  if you lift it up and let go it falls  you can do this over and over again  however  and the rock s  go down  ness  is never used up  a permanent magnet  whether a strip of rubber and iron used as a refrigerator magnet  or a powerful neodymium magnet in a machine  is nt an endless source of power  it slowly loses its power until it dies out  just like a battery  you do nt tend to notice because unlike a battery  permanent magnets are nt used to power machines  but if you tried to harness a magnet for energy you d find it d quickly deteriorate  a permanent magnet is just a substance whose atoms have been aligned to all point in the same direction  the natural magnetic field in every atom then becomes possible to harness because the fields all point the same way  rather than canceling each other out  but as you  use  the magnet  the alignment becomes weaker  and eventually the atoms all point different directions  magnetizing the substance again requires more energy  the other type of magnet is an electromagnet  a magnetic field is created whenever electrons move  like when current flows in a wire  obviously this type of magnet requires power  neither side of the coin  runs out   as it were  magnets  as you ve seen  remain magnetized  electrons also stay electrified forever  and if you trap them on a surface  like inside a capacitor  or with static electricity on a piece of wool or in the clouds   the electric field will remain until something happens to discharge it  what we use is the flow of electricity  and the  flow  of magnets  well  more like the rotation of magnetic fields   for power  but realize that we re only converting power  energy from one form to another  for example  a power plant has to use the heat from burning coal  or the force of falling water  or the heat produced by nuclear reactions in the reactor core  in order to  push  the electrons to move and create the electricity flow that you use at your house  similarly  magnets in motors have to move to produce electricity  or  in the reverse  the electricity in a motor causes the magnets to move  so we re always just converting motion or heat to electric flow  and then  at home  we re converting the electric flow back to motion or heat ,0
google and bing are both search engines that help you find information on the internet they work by looking at websites figuring out what theyre about and then showing you a list of the websites that are most relevant to what youre searching forrnrnone reason why google might be considered better than bing is that it has a larger index of websites which means it can find more information for you google also uses more advanced algorithms to try to understand the content of websites and show you the most relevant resultsrnrnanother reason people might prefer google is that it is faster and more userfriendly it has a simple design and is easy to use which can make it easier for people to find what theyre looking forrnrnin general both google and bing can be useful tools for finding information on the internet but google is generally considered to be the more reliable and comprehensive option,1
i would recommend that you establish a landlordtenant relationship instead of joint ownership ie 100 ownership stake for one of you vs 0 for the other it is much cleaner and simpler  basically one of you can propose a monthly rent amount and the other one can chose to be either renter or landlord alternatively you can both write down a secret rental price offer assuming you are the landlord then pick the landlord who wrote down the smaller rental price  if neither of you can afford the down payment then you can consider the renters contribution an unsecured loan at an agreed interest rate and payment schedule if you must have both names on the financing then i would recommend you sell the property or refinance under a single name as quickly as possible when the relationship ends if not before pay the renter back any remaining balance on the loan and leave the landlord with the resulting equity or debt  in any case if you expect the unsecured loan to outlive your relationship then you are either buying a house you cant afford or partnering on it with someone you shouldnt,0

credit cards have minimum limits for a variety of reasons one reason is to ensure that cardholders are able to make the minimum payments on their credit card balances each month credit card issuers typically set a minimum payment amount that is a percentage of the cardholders balance and this minimum payment must be made by a certain date each month in order to avoid late fees and negative impacts on the cardholders credit scoreminimum limits may also be set in order to reduce the risk of default for the credit card issuer credit card issuers take on a certain level of risk when they issue credit to consumers and setting a minimum limit can help to mitigate this risk by ensuring that cardholders have a certain level of income or creditworthinessin addition minimum limits may be set in order to encourage responsible credit use by setting a minimum limit credit card issuers can encourage cardholders to use their credit cards in a responsible manner such as by only charging what they can afford to pay off in full each month this can help to prevent cardholders from accumulating high balances that may be difficult to pay off which can lead to financial strain and potentially harm their credit scores,1

sure imagine that you live in a place called europe which is made up of many different countries each of these countries has its own money called a currency which is used to buy and sell things within that country for example the currency in france is called the euro while the currency in germany is called the euro as wellnnnow lets say that the euro is dissolved which means that it is no longer used as a currency in europe this would mean that each country in europe would go back to using its own individual currency so if you live in france you would start using the french currency again instead of the euro if you live in germany you would start using the german currency again instead of the euronnthis change would have some consequences for example if you are traveling from france to germany you would need to exchange your french currency for german currency in order to be able to buy things in germany this can be a bit of a hassle as you would need to find a place to exchange your money and pay a fee for the servicennanother consequence is that the value of each countrys currency might change for example if the french currency becomes worth more than the german currency then it might be more expensive to buy things in germany using french currencynnoverall going back to using individual currencies in europe would mean that each country would have more control over its own money but it would also bring some additional complexity and challenges when it comes to buying and selling things between countries,1
tarp was 475 billion of loans to institutions  loans that are to be paid back with interest albeit very low interest  a significant percentage of the tarp loans have been or will be paid back  so the final price tag of the tarp was only a few billion pretty low considering the scale of the program there is 10 trillion in mortgage debt outstanding  thats a much higher price tag than tarp  secondly paying off the mortgages  no repayment to the government as there was with tarp  the initial price tag of your plan would be 10 trillion instead of a few billion furthermore how does a government with 15 trillion in debt already come up with an extra 10 trillion to pay off peoples mortgages  should the government go deeper into debt  print more money and trigger inflation note  some people like to talk about a secret bailout by the fed implying that the true cost of tarp was much higher than claimed by the government  the secret bailout was a series of shortterm lowno interest loans to banks  because they were loans which were paid back my point still stands  some other issues to consider remember that the principal balance of your mortgage is only a small portion of your payments to the bank  over 30 years you pay a lot of  in interest to the bank thats how banks make a profit  banks are expecting that revenue and it is factored into their financial projections  if those revenue streams suddenly disappeared i expect it would majorly screw the up the financial industry many people bought houses during the real estate boom when housing prices were inflated far beyond the real value of the house  is it right to overpay for these houses  this rewards the banks for accepting the inflated value during the appraisal process  loan modification forces banks to accept the real value of the house the financial crisis was triggered by people buying houses they could not afford  should they be rewarded with a free house for making poor financial decisions,0

this reminds me of the movie  in time  starring justin timberlake  where everyone uses time as currency as well as to live on  in order or others to live forever  people have to die  probably not  while everybody has the legal freedom to be successful  not everybody has the means  illness  substance addiction  poverty  poor education  family  relationship problems  homelessness  prejudice  being screwed by  the man   and a whole host of other things are obstacles to success for many people  this is one of the main differences in worldview between right  wing  libertarians  and supporters of a social welfare system  the right wingers believe that generally  people are responsible for their own success or failure  but supporters of a social welfare system believe that sometimes people are screwed over by circumstances beyond their control  as you can probably tell from this answer  i m in favour of social welfare  but then again i m from europe where pretty much everyone supports this kind of system  just be aware that you re not going to get unbiased answers in this thread  no  not by the common understanding of prosperity  even though  technically we are almost all pretty prosperous historically  the issue is that people define prosperity relatively   i m wealthier than average  is comprehensible   i m wealthy  is not since we then wonder what the criteria of being wealthy are  look at it this way  most people  even people who are economically below average  have a much higher quality of life than wealthy people did living a thousand years ago  therefore they are more  prosperous  than these wealthy people  and certainly  if you are more prosperous than a wealthy person  you must yourself be prosperous  but no one considers these people to be prosperous  because as human beings we must think of things relatively  we must have some frame of reference  even for the same person we can modify whether or not they are prosperous based on whom we are comparing them to at a given moment  we can say someone is poor  or unprosperous when we are thinking in our mind of the united states but if someone were to say   yes but what about compared to the rest of the world   we would think about africa and india and such and perhaps say that yes this person is prosperous  anyway  in the end  prosperity basically means quality of life and we measure quality of life relatively  but let s take some country smaller than the us  let s go back to ancient greece and form our own small city  state of 1000 people  imagine that we are excellent at warcraft and can go and take the land and goods of many of the small nations surrounding us  we divide these spoils up and give each family their fair share  then  all our people could considered prosperous  because we would be a small nation and in close proximity to others who are less  but the united states is  i think too big  or rather it is too proportionately big compared to the total population  we make up such a big portion of the world  and occupy a fairly isolated position  surrounded as we are by oceans and few nations  that the  pool of people  to whom we compare a given person will always be comprised mostly of us citizens  so while it is possible  perhaps in some socialist country which has discovered amazing natural resource  for all the citizens in a small european country to be  prosperous   it is only because the first inclination is to take a larger pool  where the citizens of this country make up less than half of the total  for the pool of the united states  us citizens will most likely be more than half  therefore all of them can not be above average  nor even all average or above    tldr  the only way we can think about prosperity is on a relative scale  we must compare our citizens to others  and the us is too proportionally big and too isolated to every have a pool of comparison big enough  where we do nt have to compare our own citizens to other citizens   ,0

advantage of cash you can spend the money without having to pay any fees or taxes to get it out disadvantage when inflation is greater than zero which it has been for many decades your cash is continually losing value advantages of an ira roth or classic your money will usually grow as the investments return a profit you get special tax benefits disadvantages theres risk  you may lose money there are tax penalties for withdrawing the money before retirement in general you should only put money in an ira if you expect to leave it there until you retire or at least for a long time whole life is a combination of a life insurance policy and an investment advantages combines insurance and investment into one convenient monthly payment disadvantages the investment portion typically has lower returns than you could get elsewhere if you have no need for life insurance  if youre not supporting anyone or youre confidant they could get along without you or you dont like them and dont care what happens to them when youre gone or whatever  then theres no point buying life insurance whole or term youre paying for a product that you dont need its pretty common advice to tell people that instead of buying a whole life policy they should buy a term policy with the same coverage and then invest the difference in the premium for example if you were considering getting a 100000 whole life policy that costs 50 per month just making up numbers of course it depends on your age health etc and you see you could get a 100000 term life policy for 30 per month you will almost certainly do better in the long run to buy the 30 term policy and put the other 20 into investments the catch to this plan is that there are usually transaction costs to investing even a discount broker like ameritrade or scott trade charges around 10 per transaction so if you tried to invest 20 each month youd lose half of it to transaction fees which means that in practice youd have to save that money up until you had at least a few hundred and at that point many people find other things always seem to come up to spend the money on so that while they start out with every intention of investing this money they dont,0

i do nt think jokes between americans and canadians do nt have anything to do with animosity  really  it s because we re very similar that finding flaws and giving each other some grief over it is kind of a way to assert the few differences we really have  in the us anyway  it s a way to point out the absurdities in our own country  by making canada seem like this ridiculous far off place  when in reality it s right fucking there and we have a lot of similarities  see  south park   as a canadian  let me tell you  we mock you guys just as much  my roommate first year was an american  and we all had laughs at his expense  because for any other distinctive group we could talk about  there s the possibility that you might mean it  it s not so much that we joke canada a lot  but for instance we would nt tell a mexican joke because there are serious problems with the way some people perceive mexican immigrants  etc ,0

turning on the air conditioning in your car does not cause the engine to use more gas however using the air conditioning does put an additional load on the engine which can cause it to use more fuelnnheres how it works when you turn on the air conditioning in your car the air conditioning compressor kicks in and starts compressing the refrigerant gas this process requires a lot of energy and the engine has to work harder to power the compressor as a result the engine uses more fuel to produce the extra power needed to run the compressornnso while turning on the air conditioning itself doesnt directly cause the engine to use more gas the extra work that the engine has to do to power the air conditioning compressor does result in slightly lower fuel efficiency however this effect is usually small and most people wont notice a significant difference in their gas mileage when they use the air conditioning,1

one of the most obvious changes was the language  before the norman conquest  old english was the current version of the language  english is a germanic language  but we also have many latin  based words  many of which came to us as a result of the conquest by the old french  speaking normans  french is a romance language  meaning it evolved from latin origins   this began the period of the language known as middle english  which eventually gave way to early modern english  the language of shakespeare and the king james bible  and then to modern english later still  as you may know  early modern english is often very easy for english speakers today to understand  if you ve ever read shakespeare  you will probably have noticed that there are many archaic words and phrases that might lead to some confusion  but the general meaning is pretty easy to figure out  going a step back  middle english becomes far more difficult  even though there are a lot of words that are familiar and some sentences might be possible to interpret from context  that all changes once you get to old english  aside from the very different grammar  few of the words are intelligible to modern english speakers  it would probably be easier for you to read a book in spanish than in old english  even if you ve never studied either language and speak only modern english  this is partly because of the enormous language shifts that were put into motion following the conquest  as spanish is another romance language  our own language now shares many similarities to it  surprisingly  one of the things the norman conquest did nt affect very much is the language  so i m disputing u  crummocks s post here  in fact  the effect on the language was mostly limited to adding some words for things the normans put themselves in charge of  government  royalty  the courts  the military and so on  plus a few other random bits and pieces  such as the words for some meats  beef and pork  for example  but not chicken or lamb   it is a convenient date to put the transition from old english to middle english  but please dismiss from your mind any suggestion that this means there was any kind of dramatic change in the language  like all languages  english is continually and gradually evolving and changing  there was nt a sudden massive change  and transitions happened very slowly  the english spoken in 1065 was no different from the english spoken in 1067  but is quite different from the english spoken in 800  what really sets middle english apart from old english is that it s considerably more analytic  old english was synthetic  meaning you could put the words in almost any order  but there was a complicated system of grammatical endings  an analytic language is one where you have far fewer grammatical endings  but the word order is very strict  the influence of norman french probably helped with that process  but it likely would have happened anyhow  you can see this process happening in modern german  for example  while in modern dutch it s practically complete  in any case  that change did nt really get going for another couple of generations at least  which is why some language historians put the transition to middle english closer to 1150  the norman french came and conquered the existing anglo saxon english nobility  most were killed or forced to swear loyalty  often involving intermarrying  and they were replace with french nobles  this fundamentally changed the structure of the government  and even the english language  the influx of french words ranging from military terms like  lieutenant   to cooking words like  beef  and  pork  and many others  the government and military changes also established the base that eventually conquered all of the british isles  before this there were many different kingdoms that fought with each other  sometimes uniting and sometimes splitting ,0
